its stuck in my head in a way that some of thos early films definitly did not and great rugret of mine that i didn’t get to 

looking at other scores they were kinda middling  cept for reif who gave a 5 which is interesting 

this movie had heart and was going for something  i loved its weird casting  at the time since it stuck in my brain for so long  only sounds right to give a for    what are we scoringt his out of    4 bobby knights  im pro bobby night  for bobby night 
when you are constantly surrounded by diversity  you are constantly getting jokes about race
not having enough time to sit with it  it’s a fine movie to watch  not super great or anything  straight middle of the road for me  3 dead kevin costners
really really loved the meta part  and so  because of that  i am going to give drib a 3

in this spirit of watching movie and talking  this movie had stuff to talk about  don’t want to styme in this area  gave a two
i guess i was watching in a time capsule  remnants of a bygone ear  side characters funny  and they fought in some hey  for this i will give it a solid 3 spiked cigarettes
i liked this one it was fun to talk about big time symbols  like talking about the great gadspy and what its symbols and i enjoyed this shit ouf this movie 4 baobabs
i was excited to do a not good movie again  expectations were really low  what i liked was that it was edited decently  not a whole lot of fluff  action to action really appreciated  i don’t think it felt super long  the dialogue was bizarre enoguh and adr was jarring enough like are there voices in my head or my speakers  the story was really stuipd  i cannot get past the why was there a serial killer alternate story too that part was really dumg  3 like bruce lee but betters

sam  who shat the bed the hardest 
johnson  penelope cruz 
it felt like it thought everything stood for something else  but really everything stood for nothing  but it really meant nothing  nothing cohesive  
everyones criticism is 100  correct this film only deserves all the negativity it gets however when i watched it i wasn’t viscerally angery  it was just so fucking lame  instead of making choices i like dor disliked  it didn’t rock the vote  bland bland bland didnt actively make me mad so only saving grace 1 dimple
i think this movie really made me realize how much pacing made me surrounded by col things that i lvoed moment that he put on the glases world change black and white everything popped i truly lvoed that certain one liners that were really really fun i didnt hate roddy pipers portrally this isnt real maybe just an an insane homelessman killing innocent people who at the ends if that was open to interpretation oh wait maybe he was insane  that said  the pacing was really really slow  i like john carpenter stuff   music made me sleepy  2 pairs
loved first half  gettign into it  really really enjoying it  before the conversation thought i disliked more than do now  didn’t really appreciate misdirects  you guys were right my opinion has improved  thought ending was a little bit  didnt hit meas big as i wanted it to  having said that  really liked the way the film looked liked the main characters  if you give me a blind phsychic thats like a homeless blind street preist  second half a bit slow  still giv 3 donald suther licks of donald sutherlands toothpazed mustache
i really enjoyed watching this movie  visually really really awesome  really like the story  felt like a story being retold  felt like there were holes in it  like when you are telling a story everyone knows  you only leave in the really fun cool bits  but leave out the boring parts  motivations of characters were confusing  had to do a lot of assupmtins didnt really matter  did really really like it  i think of all fo the movies we atched so far  this one i would be most interested in seeing a remake  minor tweaks in the writing to make this unbelieveablly cool  sam   iphone shit  f that   scene trying to find her in subway  with better writing that scene would be movie gold  it was good but it wasnt right there  having said that really really enjoy it  3 screams  now thassa good screem   shag  this is a remake  depalma was inspired and made his version of it  not a remake more of an inspiration  johnson  the scene where hes recording really really got me  was on the edge of my seat  so spooky skeletons would love to see redone  whats the name  blowup  blowout  blowme babee  blowjob   blow   whats his head right about cocain    peewee herman 
um  so just a couple things 
1  went into it knowing little  zombies ww2  garbage 
2  looking for movies  thriller  this movie popped up  oh shit  saw it had 80  score on rt  maybe this be good 
3  would have njoyed more if not look 
4  intro nailed 
5  im simple 
6  give me d day 
7  ww2 tropes for dayz 
8  wish more americans  fuck foreigners 
9  thought story had some bones 
10  rewrite and its better 
11  whole movie felt like cutscenes from a video game i wanted to play 
12  so few heros versus so many villans 
13  in the end the action scenes nailed it 
14  loved the special effects and didnt catch the cgi messups 
15  head explode  giv eme that 
16  stuff poking out of guys 
17  face make up 
18  gross out 
19  nailed it 

dialogue sucked  tibitt was going for comic releif and war movie we gotta do it or bababab 

really enjoyed it all the way through didnt think it was a great piece of high art  enjoyed the scenes i saw  thought colors were beautiful  for that  man    between 3 and 4  gonna go with a 3 salty overlords 
so  um  going into this one  i think the film rewards the watcher  the beginning was intriguing  i had questions from the beginning til it ended  they were never resolved  i had questions about characters who endd up getting murdered anyway  give me more of these bizarre films  this was clearly some interesting persons vision  they pushed it through  i liked some of the weirdness  the main guy character an dhis family while i didnt udnerstanding him at all why is he such a monster strange weird phsycopath wife is so placating and bizaare really interesting not a good way tomake agoodo movie didn get tired watching it for sure what else i hope the whole movie was the end but the beginnign didint give a fuck th emusic choices were unbelivesabley jarring the same guy at least the after credit scene featuring darlin didnt make any goddamn sense you had to wait til the end the watched long enough to see the after credits scene this has to mean something megs this is a horror movie and megs after 10 minutes what the fuck is up with this movie  shit  shit  shit  this movie started as a solid two kissing on a one wen tinto a an adrelinate packed might of been foor felt like asshole wracked my brain dont want to go with my gut gud as 4 remember the ending hating fucking confused a 3 eaten bloody hearts in a hand 
this movie started off lightening fast  this is definitely a jordan movie  he has been complaining about movies that take too long  why are you listening to me  jordan   midgets running around that were scary  did not understand the characters  i was just along for the ride  loved the gearing up scene  two goofy characters i didnt undertand it all but for some reason i was capitvated all the way through special effects violence were cool voldemort  did not understand small towns getting destroyed noone do anything 
tall man is great but his rules were bad  all powerful but two completely unqualified people going against him  fun
sex scene fantastic 
car explosion 
spheres were great 
thoroughly enjoyed this movie 
i wrote more notes for this movie than any movie in a long time  chainsaw to the nuts gives it bonus points  i will score 4 quad shotguns  quad quad sgs

i love a good documentary and this one definitely delivered  one thing about docs too is i havent watched  a doc this old in a long time 
very niche sport glimpse to past didn’t know a whole lot but really enjoyed it  arnold and lou both exploded later on funy lil peak behind curtain as babies 
didnt have more to say other than i really liked it  most of the movie i really didnt like arnold  thought he was kind of an asshole  through this discussion i realized that maybe he was like a practical joker and i think he was incredibly charasmatic i really kinda liked him even more glad to have lived in a state he was the governonr of this movie 4 types of poeple who are the types of dgo to bite back
i didn’t share thes ame sentiment watchin this one  the pedophelia

jordan  statutory rape

johnson  underage  either way  roger not telling in his friend like very bad  not a fan  also like  just maybe i didn’t look through it the same lense  i did not enjoy it  man paul is almost mentally disabled  hes the only good character 

hehehehe  the infideleity was just really extra gross to me 

megs  what 

everyone  open it up 

johnson  and uh  yeah just uh also taking heat at this ambitions student its always painted as negative is it sexist  it didnt sit with me right this conversation was really really good so im gonna give it two juicy furits out of a fishbowl 

i was going in with a 1 but then this movie got a 2 cause the conversation 

american pie would hav ebeen a 5 pies 

jordan  johnson gave it a tow 

sam  it would have been tight to fight but instead it was tight aht you kept it tight to the chest then sprayed us at the end 

jordan  i thought you were commenting like us you took us for a turn there brother 

johnson  i am a hider of true feelings 

sam  said some shit  no perfect score then 

johnson  i lie

okay so  for me went into this one bizarre right from the top  made me go hey this is all about style  i didn’t think it was realistic  i thought th eactors portrayal was all style based from the get  this fell into that place like the movie kids  im fascinated by early 90s what the hell are kids getting away with in this city  love the genre love the era 

i liked that it was a gay movie that wasnt overlly sexualized  made this realize eazy to watch 

hated michael he was super self absorbed  intriguing watching this phsycopath create distruction and destroy himself even 

these guys flamboyantly takling like old white woman  immensely entertaining 

4 money fame success glamours 
um  so from the very beginning it had that jerry bruckheimer look with the colors and the score 

loved thes oundtrack  the dialogue was tough at points and pretty cliché  but i don’t think that actually hurt he film  cause the film was about the cars baby it was all about the cars 

a lot of the car scenes were filmed like a young man with hot wheels  not a criticism thought it was really really really good 

the good outshined the bad in this film  this is one i could watch over and over in the background mostly  that hungover sunday test of afilm this is one i could watch forever 

really really enjoyed it  realy enjoyed this convo  crazy giving 4 lazer cut poopy dog keyz that i can get my jollys off with
i agree with everyone 

some things are different 

gone in 60 seconds was fun with actors making choices and malkovich made strange   bizarre choices and i didn’t like it and never got bored in that aspect 

looks at notes 

yeah i guess it was kinda hard to follow in some cases and was gross in some cases shag was right the beginnging was good and the midle was bad and th eend was solid and rushed and th payoff didnt do it int he end whatever 

yeah 

i wanted to rate this better than i will rate it  i want to give this a three but im going to give it a 1  ill never watch it again  i want togive it a 1  im giving it 2 double wigged malkovizz
this was my first foray into old bond films  first time pre pierce brosnan  moonraker when i saw clips of it  assume all like this  this is what everyone loves about them 

i thought it was really funny  i laughed a lot more than i thought i would  the moonbggychse can you beleibe it 

vegas was too small 

i wrote some of this off because the world in 1971 maybe had better movies 

troublesome with bond being bond 

the end was weird that blofeld had a good mission  blofeld did nothing wrong  maybe bolfeld was like

loved the flaming kabobs  loved the horrifying scream
loved the car chases 

this passes the test of hungover sunday on the tv i enjoy this 

clears throat

im givin this a solid not a bad 3 moonbuggies with plenty o toole 
um 

i really enjoyed this movie  i wish i understood what was sposed to be a joke and what wasn’t 

but i really enjoyed it either way 

i said most of the things i wanted to 

i thought it was really funny  i did not like watching it by my self 

this is definitely a movie made to watch with friends

megs was working      

loved the kid interactions with adults  wanted more shittalking

certain kids i wish there were more like people with different perspectives shitting on drunkard

any movie that ends witha  bunch of children drinking beer in front of their parents and they dont care tickles me

i was gonna give a 3  generous 3  since i was lonely im gonna give it 3 cruds

hake  tanner said  you can take your first place trophy and shove it up your ass   like a new york dockworker 

they be
echoing everybody else i thin ki was really looking forward to this one and a film like this 

i knew it was going to be mostly visual just like ti was recommended to me because it was so visually cool  i didn’t know the story was going to be so not as good as the visuals  i felt like sometimes you really hear a good song but the lyrics are bad  but if you dont know english eversing sound gud 

i lubbed looking at it  the constant mirrors had my brain saying  wat dis   ultimately it wasnt there  the metaphores never turned out i really enjoyed it all the same 

there are a number of scenes that were neato to look at i looked back and said  wat dis mean  

did it make sense for a 2 hour long movie  i dunno 

i truly enjoyed this movie  will i see it again  prolly not  i enjoyed this movie beginning to end 

i sat there and thought  dis movie gud or bad  

this movie made my brain wanted to understand this movie  it perlexed my brain and made me really enjoy it  im gonna go a little bit different and steal that star back from sam and give it 4 trifecta cannabls
 side chat 
johnson  alright um  i enjoyed this movie  i didn’t think it was spectacular um but i iliked the jokes  i really liked the music  other than really the singular joke about trans people i thought all of the jokes were funny  ash hat funny 

ah this might be a below average maybe like a 2 but yeah id watch this one again with friends it definitely passes the hungeover sunday watch test i have to give it 3    3    hold on froths blown offa couple
um  first off the bat uh obviously it’s a beavis a butt head movie so expectations were set at an all time low 

i laughed out loud a couple times  the animation was poor but it was kind of comforting in a way  it felt of the era and it wasnt trying to do more than beavis and butt head in the 90s  i didnt watch that 

it wasnt a good movie but i laughed enough and 1 star is for truly hate  i enjoy it for what it was but its not good so gonna give 2 couplalittlespidamunkesy
i think reif nailed it  the plot is so secondtary to what this movie is about and in no bad way is that a bad thing to me 

there are just these little snippets of just interesting storytelling that really tickled me and i really liked it 

comic characters funny

fake advertismeents i was just relaly really laughting

guy noire so out of place and why is this character involved but i think it was written with very good care and i foudn it indearing i really really likeed it

he got beans as a chaser and i just thought relaly like loved that

um

anythign else  certain choisced by garrisseon keeler i thought were bizzar but not a bad thing i guess i just gave some leeway in some of the writing a radio guy writing his first movie

i loved the way it was shot it was beautiful

i really really wanna give this a 4 cause i enjoyed this conversation  i wasnt sure how i felt about it um  god  3 is such a lukewarm aw screw it im giving this 4 failed rolled cigarettes by the kevin kline 

sam  is it failed rolled cigarettes or failed cigarettes rolled by 
im gonna go 

um  first off  the theme song is amazing  i think ive listened to it 3 or 4 times today  that’s great  that’s where the good sounds end and bad sounds end 

sound design was really distracting  i wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt for time but not gonna 

loved the style of shooting  loved the zoom ins that were kinda cliche now but not then 

i laughed a lot  the dubbing felt almost like mxc or kung pow enter the fist where i was giggling at it thinking it was a joke 

the story  while fun  i didnt really follow it  i think i got the gist of it but i think it could have been better 

i can see where other people built on what this story did really well  but yeah  uh  i enjoyed it but that doesnt necessarily mean its a good movie but im gonna give it 2 coffins that are filled with machine guns but is now filled with gold
benwah balls

ill just read what i wrote after finishing this movie last night pretty inebriated 

wow  was it entertaining  yes 

what did it mean  i don’t know 

maybe it was too much story being pushed into one story 

maybe this manga is super deep and extra details crammed in but didnt work right

great reif movie  perfect no  night is long walkon girl was better 

without seeing visuals would not have enjoyed this movie very much  it had animation issues  it was always interesting to look at 

i liked the glimps of the world to look at  i wish there was more described it would have been really cool too much to look at nice to look at story was bizzarre didnt hate it gonnagive 3 uncles who dont give a shit about their nephews
yeah so i liked the comedy i likeed the writing the three comedy characters writing and talking 

dashelss caracter was really thought out and good arc 

i thought it was shot really well  my eyes really liked to see this film  i liked it 

thats where the fun ended for me 

the main character was a phsycopath  he was jealous without any empathy  he liked  i guess a girl but he showed no real possession her was part of movie but ends up with her but it wasnt 

i dunno i just didnt like it it was this gross yuppie thing and um throughout our talk we talk about how its implied that all these characters come from money oh i guess so it kinda makes sense and makes me hate them more 

yeah    i dunno  maybe the cultural difference betwen the 90s and now suggests that the 90s are gross 

i dislike the 90s  and these characters 

as not a jealous character i dont connect with the movie either 

um  yeah  the part about therapy is where people grow  the main character wanting to be in it is actively not growing at all but if he ends up with the girl at the end it makes zero sense he should lose for not growing 

in conclusion i liked the way ti looked  i like the humor  i hated the characters  i dont want to watch it again  this will be rounded up to 2 group therapy sessions with peter bogdonovich 
i was really really llooking forward to this film  glad sam picked it  this was nostalgiac for me i was happy to watch it in my gramparents house and my mom and uncle were laughing so hard and it was a cool experience when the jokes went over my head  that built up in my head that it was going to be really good 

there were tons of stars in it i was like ooo i want to talk about this  ultimately the movie was chaos 

it was a jumbling of snl bits thrown on top of each other on top of a facade of a linear plot 

this movie is not to be watched by yourself in a basement on your laptop  this is a movie to be watched with friends doing low scale drugs or drinking with friends  this was a low scale movie 

jack black i had no clue who he was  overall i really did enjoy this 

i really wanna give it a 4 but it s not a 4  its not up to that kinda stuff  its definitely a high 3  i give it a 3 attacks by mars

hake editorial correction  i didnt say that shit 
i think i experienced this movie like i would walking into an art gallery 

i walk into a collage where there is a common theme but i enjoyed certain pieces more than others  i understood some parts more than others i grasped that i twas pointing towardst he same thing 

this was outta left field i felt like it was a good movie for this type of discussion 

yeah you not sposed to discuss arthouse but this was good for different perspectives that we had but i had perspectives that were different from other peoples

it was cool

was it necessarily enjoyable to watch all the way through  maybe not but i enjoyed anticipating the conversation  yes 

holy fuck i cant wait to hear what others think of the lunacy i just witnessed

yugolsave scene where the main character preaches about sexual iberation  maybe propoganda but i loved this scene

wish i could watch on a big screen with a bunch of people

overall i loved this movie and really liked it so i give it 4 sex soccer ball vibes 

jordan  both lips or into mouth 

sam  rating your own movies higher than others rate them  name a more dynamic duo 
your mom will go next 

i really enjoyed this movie  thought the intro was awesome  loved the time we spent in the not real world 

the greek kind of everybody but the human world was fine  the end was tremendous 

i was confused about who it was for  i feel like they could have rewrote the monkeybone to not be about boners  and then the movie would have made less sense  something we would not have loved and it was cultish and dirty and blue and stuck in this spot who is this movie geared twoards and it made it suffer a little bit 

i laughed a ton during this  i did really like it  going into it i was like ive been rating my movies on whether i liked watching them or if it was a good movie if i was to rank a movie on whehter it was good     easy 1

execution is poor
watcher must make leaps
brain spell out

based on how i liked it  and how much i am kind of excited to watch it again with people i am going to follow jordan 4 organs from a dead chris kattan 

so i like matthew mochonoghay  i like his craziness  i liked his performances that was fun

my problem with th emain characters  

while i think the ideas that are about chan tat character made me like him more when i watch it i was like ugh this bullshit artest caracter is super annoying 

then ant the end he sees it  he sees he bullshit but movie does weak ass ending where he ends up with the girl who should hate him but they go on a date but its like no  lets have a date in 7 hours what could we do in then

her brother in tampa is through a pee filter but everything else was fun and overall i liked a lot of the portralyes but i didnt like the story the story at its heart did nothing for me i give this tttt 2 catfuls of ghb 
winging it 

 everyone checks their notes 

 sam defends his improv 

um  i enjoyed this movie i thought it was good  i like d afiml about gys experimenting with alchohol doesn’t blame alchohol for any of it they make their own choices which i liked a lot  i tought it was cool l loved seeing them all intoxicated together like seeing them as adults next weekends hang which is really relaly fun martins character was incredibly intereting he made me so sad everytime i looked at him he has the saddest face on the planet    it just made me sad  

what else did i hav eto say about it  i did write this sthi movie was a bad infulence at one point  drinkin sazeracs with the boys lissnen to relly cool music you can buuy your wine palmer fresh cod 

this movie worked really well i hate danish language on my ears 

the visuals were so good i wanted to stop looking at the subtitles to enjoy what was on the screen so i rewond but at home its not a big deal but on the big screen cant do it the same 

i am looking forward to hakes next major screenplay 

this felt like something shage would write and film the framing was a daniel jacobson film  t 

overall gonna have to give this a 3 with a point in front with b  a  c 
i think this movie was trying to make an indictment against capitalism but the vehicle was flawed and not well explained  big hang up

i wish that the cards would have been scarier  i do like that it was like a teamup with collge thats interesting 

wish the cable or quantum companies were scarier 

really what the hell is with the connecting cubes with cables  why is it a constant requirement  sems like a bad deisgn for a computer 

wanted weird shifts in reality due to quantum fields  you know like people scared of 5g  like if i t was bonkers like that but since it wasnt super bonkerss the need to run cables on the surfance to enable high speed trading or somethign i dont know 

i feel like this movie was trying to make a big statment and i was rooting for it and it was supposed to be engaging but it ididnt keep up the crazy i dont think ill watch this film again  

it was an enjoyable ride 2 completely out of place pillow fights 
ok so  i picked this movie knowing zero about it  im not even quite sure why i picked it  but i guess im glad i picked it 

it was interesting  i think the director was trying to make us have certain feelings for all the major characters then our intial feelings got kind of clouded in the middle but then at the end it gets swithed around 

rapist    phsyco
rapist    dr

in the film it could have been better  i like what shag said i think the core concept was the issue was interesting and they kinda backed into it and the backing into it was problematic 

antonio banderes holy shit he was awesome to watch  the tiger scene will live on in movie club lore for just being a crazy scene with a lot of opinions but all together it was a gross scene  yeah  i loved the conversation tonight but i wont let it affect my score i think this one shot right down the middle for this one and im gonna give it 3 nonconsentual vaginaplastys
so  i loved the comment that i didn’t know earlier that this was friedkin s favorite film to shoot  because i think that mirrors my opinion  this movie feels like a highlight reel of the director and his skills  variation of shots  special effects  the vibes created throughout the film were really really good  i liked the performances he got out of the actors too 

i felt like this movie could have been edited better  could have been tidied up and more punchy  loved the music 

loved the characters in the jungle  tension in the vehicle scenes  working with each other  wisht ehre was more character development in the jungle 

this movie did a lot of things but didnt make a choice about wha tit was tright to do  you figure it out  ywould have like to know what more of wha tit was going for  

i did enjoy it when i was watching it  it wasa  lot of fun  even thought we nitpicked it here maybe it was little too harsh on it with freinds i would watch it totally confident giving it 3 drips of nitrogen nitroglycerine
uh  so this was like a cool drink of water  this was so refreshing to watch  not saying nothing bad about them but this was waesome  this was awesome 

loved this one cant believe i seen it before  kid narrator pretty good  fuedal japan was super dope  fight scenes give me more and more blood fuckin dig it  sound track dig it  if that car had more blades possible i say load it up  the cart could hav emore blades love the tropes this was fantanstic img ivin this an easy 4 swords 
i was really excited to do a car   racing movie  i was way too excited 

even at the beginning i saw mario andretti at the beginning and im like this is gonn abe dope  and then i twas real bad 

i couldn’t get over that there were two separate women in the film who had been with two different racecar drivers and that was just    normal 

i think we touched on it  im glad that while it was creepy and sexist it didnt get overtly sexual so saving grace there 

thank god it was written and starred in by sly stallone instead of steve segall that would haunt my nightmares 

this gets a 1 distressed denim cowboy hats 
um 

another steve segall film 

another one that seems handwritten by him to constantly give him compliments to tell him how hot and powerful and how much of hero he was

but that didn’t irritate me this time 

lvoed the action  the cars was funny  prepped for cool stuff to talk about

young eva mendez  tom alrnold was funny

i thought tk was funny

loved unlimited bullets in every scene

wish it went more extra  just turn it up to 11 if you gonna be crazy  i guess heroin t shirts kinda

wish that the commander would have gotten a better ending  that was a real bummer

this was like movie club movie the entire time i was fuckin pumped i lvoed it

loved the dmx music  and dmx suprised me 

i thought he was gonna be garbage  but he was passable 

so yeah  i loved it

segall  named his character orin  that was annoying 

lvoed it  give this bad boy 4 starchy heron turdshurts
so i agree this was at an end of spectrum of movies i guess i had never experienced  so in that way im glad this was picked  this was a great movie night pick  i really enjoyed how visceral i felt  like i felt this movie more than i felt the other ones  

none of the movies made me want to throw up through it 

i pride myself on    i fasted forwarded through part of that gaping butthole scene 

it made me feel  snuff films i dunno  that part i really liked 

it was genuinely funny  any movie that says turd a bunch will satisfy my lessor humor urges 

i really did like all of those things 

the moment i finished this movie i wa slike holy shit im gonna give this a 1  the acting  cinematography  acting  this movie felt like the way you would edit a movie with your first video camera and if you fucked up a scene too bad 

its in there forever 

but i do  it reminded me a lot of mysteries of the organism 

it was arty trying to say something that was just out fo reach  maybe thats just me tyring to givne it too much credit 

imma give 1  keep this typ eof weird fuckin crazy mind opening  im gonna give this the highest honor i can give it 2 gaping butholes 
im ready to go 

yeah so uh i really am really pumped everyone joyed this and scratched the iteches

i was really hpoing this wasn’t going to be terrible cause i was you know didn’t know anythign about it and i didn’t want to pick another medium raw

i did agree with everybody that 70s super seriosu really fun crazy gunfights explosions really enjoyable  just enough plot to not be stupid 

you could really follow and just having 3 main characters who had fun dialogue and they seemed super cool with each other really really like dit 

yeah making nazis the badguys  perfect 

i did not need complexiity  i needed something  no pun  black and white  it went down smooth

super pumped everyone enjoyed i would like to watch at can can somenight 4 patriotic topless biker torturers
this was the first time i had ever seen this movie  which seems kind of crazy  i really enjoyed it 

right off the bat  i really loved just watchign movies that know they are movies 

its not trying to tick me into being something real  its played for the camera 

this movie was play really well as a funny highschool aged stage production  that would be awesome 

this seemed written for the stage  really liked the comedy beats  jay and silent bob  every time on screen i was laughing out loud 

i agree what everyone else said our main two heros  kinda tough to watch 

jason lee  he s awesome  i love watching him talk  but his character annoyed me the whole time  jeremy london   we already talkin bout him 

this movie def be stronger if they lost at the end instead of winning 

i enjoyed it  iddnt look at me phone engaged em 

im gonna gvie a zero hot takes score of 3 melted chocolate stink palmbs  chocolate coverated stink plambs 
so  yeah  i liked a lot of moments in this film  i watche dit by myself and reround to watch the scenes again because they were so funny 

otherwise  long long scenes and cuts of the movie like  wtf is going on 

the movie didn’t take itself super seriously  so i didnt  i thought i missed a lot because of this conversation  there were chunks missing 

i thought this movie made me feel kind of silly  i must have fallen asleep 

the lead characters had good relationship  it could have been better but i liked how both characters were stupid and one thinks they are smart 

im incredibly glad to have seen this movie  i think it was a cool pick  thank you shag for doing it  i feel lik my life is better having watched it  thus im going to give this aaaaaaaaa 2 roberts  rogers and clark hit records 

 heckling ensues 

jordan  dig it 

this movie felt super long  like i said  i paused this a lot 

every time i was super stunned that three minutes had gone by 

the beginning of the story felt like a startreck episode  end jumped the shark  but not in a way i enjoyed 

maybe if i liked it or enjoyed it like a comedy  maybe i would really enjoy it but it seemed like it  it made me sleepy i would say 

travolta s acting was  um    it definitly kept my attention  it made me chuckle a lot of times  he was tryin somethin  he was tryin somethin 

aliens ugly  dope 

learning machine super stupid 

zero chance i watch battlefield earth again 

1 cyclo genociderz 

so i came in to this kind of critical of this movie 

i thought the ah  iinfidelity and excuses for it were just so blatant or morally bankrupt or something  but 

this conversation has been really really good and i think it changed my perspective a bit and i realized that its a bit more complicated and uh  whats the word 

looking for  uh  finessed the relationships  the range of human emotion or something 

this conversation changed my mind there  really loved that happening loved the way it was told all 4 actressess were really really good  i would love to watch this 

really love that holly was on this call to give that some perspective too 

because of that i will give this a 3 enduring friendships   
alright  so 

i dig time travel moobies 

i don’t usually think they do it very well  but using the single character aspect had my brain just really really diggin it the whole way through 

yeah so came into this loving it  realized you bozos dont think about it hard enough  becuause you are too simple minded go back to watching to wait to exhale 

4 flaming faces 

 reactions 

sam  that was the least johnson review  not questioning  confidently saying your thing like a badass 
first off  i love musicals  truely i do  i think they are really fun and i just get into them  this movie was colorful and silly and i know i should haven t taken it seriously  but maybe i did a little too much  the story was really dumb and i was constantly looking around to ask someone  what the heck is going on     this whole thing seemed like a weird cash grab and i wasn t a fan  i really liked this conversation though and it has affected my score for sure  with that i give this bad musical a 2 tbds 

i was really excited to do this movie  seeing a foreign film that was soviet influenced 

thought there was a lot of mr magoo and mr bean inferences  i liked doofus bumbling around making mistakes 

its not high art and it doesn’t speak against power or anything like that  but i thoroughly enjoyed this  great movie nite pick 

really wanna give this a 4 but like i dont know if it gets to that echelon  would love to watch this drinking vodka with a drink of my boys 3 robes with mother of peral buttons 
i haven t watched as much batman as everyone else here  so i was excited to see this one again   i liked it but it wasn t my favorite  i m excited to watch more batman stuff after this conversation  so i ll give it 3 batarangs 


im gonna continue sams momentum  i really loved this movie  the first time i paused this was 45 minutes in because i had to go pee  i was like holy shit i gotta go pee and we are only 45 minutes in  i should have timed it 

hahahahahha 

i was loving this film  i loved the uh  chemistry between the main two characters and i lvoed the quick insults  they were so good  the performances were fantastic  julie andrews is a vocal gem 

i really liked the whole thing with king  i voiced my criticisms  i wish it would have been pushing boundaries to the next level  i could have written a better ending 

all that said  holy shit did i enjoy this  the whole time watching it  megs watched this with me  i was like holy shit this one might be a 5  i dunno  this is hittin me different 

this conversation did nothing to change that  add this to the top tier of movies with movie club  im gonna give it 5 norma s small rages 
so watching this i was definitely bummed that i didn’t watch this when i was 13 or 14  this had so many references that i think woulda been really funny upper tier maybe in my childhood if i watched it then 

having said that  i was nervous going into this  while i thought it was funny  i wasnt sure how much everyone would dwell on the problematic stuff even if it could bog you down everyone had the exact same kinda liked it but problematic stuff thought was funny when i was 12 or 13 not funny now but laughed at the time 

thought i was gonna give 3 but this one gonna stay with me more so im comfortable giving it 4 melted beercanhands 

really loved the concept  and this conversation has been amazing  and has painted this film in a new light where i do think that it will probably continue to grow on me like a cult film 

i have to be true to how i was feeling while i watched this movie  because i paused it and only 8 minutes had gone by 

part of watching by myself  i guess i really needed a plot  and since it iddnt have a plot it put me in a bad mood and i wasnt having it 

i would have asked to atomize and pull in pile dust so i give it 1 cigarrettes
i was really excited picking this film  because when i said it  people cheered  fucking yes  i nailed it 

before i watched it  some of the text messages started rolling in  like a reference to medium raw  and i was like oh no  did i just medium raw dogg my friends again  oh my god i was discgusted 

i liked the intro  it lagged in the middle doing to o muhc  main complaintes about movies this comes hard in that third act  we have been wanting a 3rd act  i liked ending on a good note  i think going into tonight this was a 2  but this conversation gave me more of an appreciation for it  it was absurd in the right ways and didnt get problematic and overall i thought as far as silly stupid horror movies go this one was fuckin fun and had great effects and th eblood was terrible but really good so im gonna give this 3 spooky maggot rain houses 
the skipper of the movie must be a real turkey 

i enjoyed the silliness of this movie  i think one of the faults is that there are other zombie movies that are better 

i don’t want to compare to other movies because that’s tough sometimes 

the music worked but it was more of a detriment 

i liked the craziness of it  the shark scene will stick with me for a long time  i thought   what the fuck is happening 

the gore was repulsive such as the eye gouge and big bites  i almost had to squint my eyes  which was awesome 

ultimately  part of it was tough was that i didnt care about the characters and didnt feel anything 

in the end  while i loved the twist ending with new york  it couldnt quite do it 

yeah  i am ultimately glad i watched it  2 tits out scuba divers 
kevin  noooo im dropping down in my likeability of movies  guys pick better movies 

jordan  what is that  total score  total stars 

johnson  i blacked out through a lot of this film  it kept my eyes attention  boner  but none of it really stayed in my brain 

but nothing really mattered  dennis miller was atrocious  i hated everything in it  the bones of the film coulda been fun if executed differently 

the gore was awesome  the gross out cool horror parts were done really solidly  i know the director did quite a few of the tv show  and he had the chops but some of the other stuff fell flat 

im not angry i watched it and i dont wanna give it a 1  i would throw this on the background cause its weird and cool to look at  no 1 cause not angry but cant give 3 cause  yikes  so imma give this 2 express trains to tuna town 
so  this was a tough one for me  because it was really really hard to follow 

we brought it up that you should let this film wash over you… once i realized the acting was a choice and not just bad  then i watched movie 

the cinemtography gave me nausia 

i guess i m not totally sure what this film is trying to say  i guess it was just a confusing  visceral  trying to get down what feeling though a divorce and it s just chaos 

this one didn t set super great with me  i was upset at it a couple of times  is this gonna be my first zero  i dunno 

but it s not  i don t know what it was gonna try to say  i ll give it 1 trashcan feather 
 clears throat 

i feel like so many times we watch these films and they do one act really well and maybe 2 acts and then it falls apart and makes the whole thing a slog 

this one was fantastic to watch and i really really liked it  it was tight filmmaking  loved the shot selection  felt very alfred hitchcock and cathy bates is amazing and james kaan his joices were so cool and very believable and yeah   meow 

every scene had something i really enjoyed  no faults on this  this is kind of a boring review  when it comes to horror this one creeps up on you in a really really good way  this film doesnt bash you over the head 

its weird to discuss a legitimately good movie on here  so it gets 5 bitchly cow corns 
coward

thanks

i agree with a lota things hake said  i really enjoyed this one 

th emade for tv aspect lowerd my expernctations which made me enjoyed it more 

im not a super real knowledgable about the johncarpenter work  instead of like sam 


my own ignorance made my experience better  be dumber sam 

i enjoyed the characters and a liked what the movie going for gave leeway made for tv 

yeah i guess i imagined constraints in my brain making me like it even more

the psychological elements made it like hitchcock and the reality seeing and nobody believing  horrifying and liked it 

really hated the ending  hated that the bad guy i just hated that it wasnt a mystery that the badguy was just a random person taht whatever 

overall enjoyed so for that it is a bad it is not a good movie its a made for tv movie it is what it is comfortable 3 almost grabbed shards of glass  no hot takes from johnson 

sam didnt make it feel like it one instead of jordan  gave me 3 instead 4 incredible one 

chasm between 3 and 4 is pretty big and 4 and 5 is massive  especially for me where 3 is like no mans land

i regret 3 2 is in my heart i said 3 cant go back 
ill go 

initially totally understand why this is a cult film  riding the same vein as rocky horror 

this movie had like little prince  i understood the metaphors and see what im trying to see 

it was insane and kooky 

i loved the visuals really enjoyed the music 

casting was solid 

parts were rushed  but kept the pacing of the movie quick  so i didnt get bored 

i guess i kinda played my hand throughout i really really enjoyed this film  this was a cool glass of water  definitely deserved 4 beef for me 
so i thought this was a pretty great movie for movie club  i havent seen orsen welles  accent was crazy  what the hell is going on  keep me really engaged  got halfway excited through the conversation 

funhouse stuff and the court room scenes were really entertain 

thought was really funny at the end  wish it was as funny as end  payoff was a little    you know  coulda been cooler at the end but not mad at it  overall this doesnt fall into stuff im stoked to watch again but im ultimately really glad i talked about  closed to a 4 but a 3 sweaty excitable grizbees 
firstoff super pumped that everybody seemed to have enjoyed this one 

picking it it would be fun or really everyone hates me

even after watching i was like  man this coulda go every way 

loved the coloring of this one  the vibe was bright and really cool 

obviously practical effects were amazing  

weller being cast was a break or make for this film  he was capitvating in the way he portrayed bill lee 

surrealism  sometimes i hate it and sometimes i dig it  this time i dig it 

i had zero idea what was going on but i dont understand the plot really well  but this time it was teasing me and i just they about to tell me and the ending happened and confused me even more 

that was th emost perplexing scene of the whole movie 

my initial thought was fuuuck that 

then at work i could not stop thinking about what the movie was trying to say  realizing its more of a biography  elevated it more in my mind 

looking forward to seeing again  truly dont understand what happened  really really liked it 

with shag this is a sold 3 for me  throughout the conversation  before seeing reviews  dont wanna be swayed give stick with my gut 3 sips with my mugup jhisms 

jordan  i thought you were gonna be a fuckin stolen valor punk 

johnson  it made me feel better

johnson  we will see it s legs 

sam  reference for a wahile

jordan  till action boys 

i really enjoyed this movie  went in with zero expectations except tat my little experience with swingers i wanted good color and goods shots 

i liked interesting angles  late 90s time capsule feel to it  i dunno got me right into it  raves drugs house music  lets fuckin go 

the stakes were higher and noone died or injured was feel like after school special in a way

didnt make me hate it  thought movie coulda been way better

so many ways could be so much worse  dialogue was fun action was fun i dont have negative things to say about this one 

yep

so was it fantastic  absolutely not  but i thoroughly enjoyed watching this from beginning to end  big plus to me 

this was like nekked lunch solid 3 5 shit right here  didnt push enough of the buttons to push over ed so honest 3 crunchy herbal rave shits 


gives review 

another madds mikkelson foreign language film im for him so far ive liked both of em decent amounts 

thought this was pretty funny see a scene and o wait that’s a joke laugh at myself

i thought the nerds didn’t annoy me as much as other people and tey were all stupid in their own way and really funny bumbling dufuses and technical knowhow and social salamis that amde them lovable for so reason

outa all of the characters i dislike mads the most cause he doesnt grow and is one note and mads acted it well but fell flat  everyone else was really cool 

overall thought it was funny thought it was cool 

nothing means anything everything is chaos everything is random right down the middle with three chubby salamis 

sam  that s a nice little snack 
i got really excited at the beginning of this conversation because i think that disagreement sometimes leads to the most fun conversations 

so i really enjoyed that aspect of that conversation about tom  and i realize i came across coming across a fuckin tom apologist which is really bizarre 

it kind of made me think more of  someones watching me  in certain scenes 

good storytelling  the story was kinda bland  but the way it was told was well executed 

i thought it was funny and endearing and clever 

wasnt best picture worthy or anything like that 

so yeah    i think we discussed it really well already  its better than a 3 but not good enough to be  a 4  so 3 orange concentrated screwdrivers  3 screwdrivers from concentrate 
ill be here but im gonna pee 

so didn’t know anything about this film at all but john goodman had me excited 

loved how silly ths movie was even thought not taking itself seriously  watching through eyes of 12   13 me  yeah i would ve awe man i wish there was a movie in my hometown coulda gone through woulda been so cool 

i smiled and laughed through this whole thing cool drinka water neice and nephew and mant  was so funny every time it cam eon the screen really really digging it 

i dunno wholesomeness really strucken to me  but was great movie  no  but i go with gut and give 4 shopping cart uncles 
so i felt like i know this was an art house movie but this felt like something i would find myself standing in front of a screen at an art museum and each scene i would see people in their apartments and like  this one is boring  and then they all kind of  i dunno  i liked the geometric shapes and sterility of it and hyper choreographed nature of itall 

then restaurant absurd chaos and all that goes awy and just so interested to look at  im usually hyper critical of movies with zero plot but this one felt good to me 

i enjoyed watching but more about talking abou tit more  better to watch in a group and better to watch a second time and then i would rewind and you see some gag in the background and i was like  omg thats so cool  and i like when tehre is some stuff going on everywhere 

conversation really took it to 4 territory  im kinda conflicted 

jordan interjects   you liked it more than me and i gave it a 3 

but no  i think this one had enough  really fresh something for my eyes and ears  something i would nota picked on my own gonna go with 4 crown brands as entry passes into recursive clubs  crown brands with cheeze  crown royale 
i really enjoyed this moobie  i even thought through the first half i was really uncomfortable with jeff daniels being a dirtbag and i didn’t know this woman 

it was a fun fantasy that i decided to let go and so happy about the background shit with the priest and nun inexplicably at the reuinion and civil war reanactment 

ray mentioned at length 

i really really liked this  i do give it a bit more benefit of doubt for mid 80s like a different time like sometimes i give it that benefit and im inconsistent and i dont care  i really realy like this film 4 virginias for lubbers t shirts 

alright so i watched this last night and ive never seen it before 

at first i was like okay  an irreferent comedy something stupid from middle school and it was and i laughed a bit 

i was like if on sunday on tnt and im in nursin a hangover with friends this would be really fun 

i thought we would have a lot to talk about and that i missed soemthing  but no i think i saw all the funny parts 

it was silly pretty enjoyable  2 flawless cgi titty cups 

i went first cause i wanted higher scores 
don’t hava ton to say 

i was really excited to watch this movie  i remember seeing it in video rental stores  and i had a false memory of seeing it on comedy central 

interesting time capsule from the 90s that was neat to see 

the beginning was kinda boring  but i did enjoy just being like   holy shit what are these choices mike meyers is making  

not a huge fan of him but after this movie so excited to talk to you guys about it which counts for something 

terrible subtitles with this movie 

didnt discuss the chemistry between mike and nancy    i didnt really believe that  i loved the twist at the end 

i didnt see that coming and thought it was pretty awesome 

really enjoyed this conversation 

wanted to give this just a 1  but this conversation definitely proved that there were much more reedeeeming parts 

this is getting 0 woman but 2 wooooooah mans   2 units 
i started this movie last night and finished it today after work 

was not having an enjoyable time last night  really did not like it 

usually this yuppie 90s wealthy people are sposed to be loved for being financially successful for whatever reason turns me off 

so yeah i didnt like it  so i had 30 minutes left and i turned it on and i liked it and i felt like richard gere changed and grew in those 20 minutes  becoming a human and not a psycho path 

the movie won me over and like  oh i think i liked that 

there s plenty of reasons without julia roberts this movie stinks but she is able to elevate the entire thing 

the movie tricked me and the part at the end hes like what does the prince do and shes like  she saves him too 

and i was like that s what this whole thing was the whole time disney gushing like a moron i was bamboozled 

hate begin  liked end  so three steamy polo divits 
after first coupla reviews waiting someone coming outta edgy review could fall behind with shags being excellent describing this movie love audry hepburn and photo in the bathroom 

something about limitations of films shot in this era like scenes with no sound they overcome those challenges and make something enjoyable to watch that was always designed that way 

whole movie was really really wholesome and like shag it was really close to being a perfect film it challenges the audience and that s not what it was going for but that s fine i love the film so gonna give it 4 truthy hands inside a monster gods mouth 
i fuckin lub romance and cigerets 

i love when film is a show  walken fuckin ridiculous is insane  the biting the dancing the writing 

i fuckin lubbed it  connection between a romance and a wife was difficiilt i was so fuckin bummed i missed the conversation  two from ben  what the fuck is that about 

4 cucumbers in the gardeners ass 

i would love to bat the cycle  but there is zero chance that im giving this a 5  because it would negate a lot of my earlier scores 

i was perplexed a ton through this 

1  it talked about self cutting  which i don’t claim to know  a ton about 

2  bdsm which i dont claim to know a ton about 

3  it claimed it was a comedy  but now i dont know what comedy is 

but beyond that  i thought it was really clever  i loved the way maggie and james spader were acting of each other  i thought  i dunno  i thought it really worked well  they had a ton of chemistry even throughout his weirdness and quirckyness 

we touched on the movie  thought it oculda be a bit more tidy but specially towards the end i thought it was fun  and i guess i didnt take it too too seriously i thought of it all through the lense of a fantasy so i gave it a lot of leeway 

jordan  lee halloway

having said that i cant give it a 5  honestly cant give it a 4  wanna give over a 3 but cant give film 3 hairbrush spanks in hairbrush bafroom 
daniel  this had hard matinee vibes and this was another ryan pick  you picked your lane 

sam  it has been fun to see you show us your movie club vibes 

jordan  sum of all it s parts  industrial and lookin 

ryan  i gotta get out of art deco 

johnson back  okay cool 

i really enjoyed this movie i feel like it got the big benefit of the doubt 

been busy like this is one the huge thing i really relazed watchin it i havent watched the last couple with a super discerning eye or critical eye but this made me watch this one with really really enjoy it 

it was like  he was an asshole   and then like yeah but the negative things were going way over my ehad and didnt really notice 

i loved this 1930s lookback the wholesome in a way that uh i feel too weird being negative on with confines of hollywood thing i dunno 

loved the plane stuff was awesome been to the bulldog cafe won it huge points coulda rewrote this better  llc  there was a really cool bassist that could have made it really cool 

thank you really ryan for making it vhs cover fuckin coolest movie in the world cause outfit so fuckin cool gonna give this 4 slices of beamons chewing gum 
90 minutes is a big deal  no forget that respect 

this was about the longest 90 minute long movie ive seen in a while i paused and continuously was flummoxed at how much was left 

watching this i enjoyed enough of it  i thought really interesting at the gate  i dont know how much the writer has figured it it out in an interesting way  we came up with all the ways this could be improved  there s definitely a kernel of what is good i was glad we had a break of a week on movie club and it faired and half of the time we were just chattin about other stuff bonkers bizzarre as movie and it just wasnt interesting enough to keep our attention to talk about 

it wasnt interesting it was weird but it wasnt interesting but kinda stunk and because of that i would give it 1 but david hyde pierce s just insanity my eyes couldnt look any place else  without him i would not even be capitivated as interested and every just naile dit with 2 cheeky lil mystery boxes 
okay uh  i thought this movie was fine  i thought that it was really silly and so if i didn’t try to be to critical i enjoyed it 

billy kristil caracter was miscast  danny devito character was lovable in a kind of stupid idiot kinda way  danced with too stupid 

did an okay job 

first time i heard momma speak she was gonna be hated by me but then i loved her and laughed out loud at some of the ridiculous stuff she said 

movie had tons and tons of flaws  but it was short  i never paused and was like how much time is left 

enough dumb humor to keep me engaged  not actively to have watched it too many flaws to middle of road so it falls to a 2 clumsy poops  copies of 100 women id like to pork 
sure ill go 

so yeah  i enjoyed this film 

im watching it really surprised that i never caught it before 

was this on rotation on tnt like shawshank 

you gotta bleepin it mosta the time 

dad told me bout midnight run but not on tv somewhere 

especially the 90s and bethovens dads career noway 

it had a lot of the qualities of the heavy rotation movies  not as a nock  but i coulda seen myself watching in the middle all the way to the end  you dont gotta put the pieces together  they will tell you which i enjoyed 

i loved the relationship between the two  i wish robert deniro had a better growth arc  maybe it did and i wanted too much  but yeah everyones super cool in this film 

i dont have anything else original to say 

im surprised with how many 4s  this coming into it feels like a solid 3 for me  so i stick to my solid guns and stick to a 3 and enjoyed the film for others but not for me  3 non counterfiet counterfiet 20s  thats how many the bar got to keep 
so  i was really excited for tonight because i took 3 pages of notes  most in a long time  long movie  a ton to look at  a lot of the times i was very confused and along for the ride  really glad to see that jon woo spoke about this movie  and didn t really care about plot structure or creating a cohesive story 

he did what was right in the moment  and that mirrored my experience 

it was a ton of fun  was a video game movie from the 90s  didnt know much about it  it was a little long  some of the action scenes just kept going on and on and on 

i feel really stupid complaining about that  they dont make movies this bonkers  i dig it  the music was really good and so that was dope too 

im gonna go by gut this time  didnt make sense this genre was being too critical by me in my brain this wasnt sposed to be a comedy im gonna give it from my gut 4 day saving little piss pots 
clears throat 

first i agree with ryan  or i get why ryan s mom or my mom didn t want us to watch this film when i was little  too dirty for me 

i loved what sam said about having terry gilliam doing this film  i know i mentioned the thing about the kids  the other thing is that the establishing shots at the beginning was so awesome  even the military presence is so over the top it doesn t feel like the real word  then they are like  vietnam exists  and maybe everywhere is like bonkers in this universe 

i love world building and this took the perfect first step and then just doesnt do anything with it 

i think pretty much everyone said just about everything that i felt 

i think that this conversation was the best thing in the movie 

too much space between the way they were conmbine di didnt really dig talking about them made me laugh a lot 

so heay that s all i got i didn thate this movie as much as i thought i would once it started 

i think its overall creativity wins it a ton of points 

3 peas and carrots in a problematic pea pile 

i do have problems with infantile characters having unprotected sex
i agree  awesome pick reif for first epic selection  this one felt shorter than a lot of the othe rmovies that were significantly shorter in run time 

the fact that it was based on a real event  that brought something new to movie club that we havent had in a long time 

that was a blast to discuss and lots of fun things to think about 

the movie was pretty  the writing was kind of whatever 

i was fascinated by the overall story that fascinated me 

need to read some articles and stuff 

right inbetween two for me  but im definitely gonna remember this one positively so gonna give this one 4 turds in a bowl 

from the very get of this film uh it screamed at me  this is a cult film that somehow slipped unner the radar 

i coulda believe i even had passing it   thanks hake i think canadian humor is like kids in the hall 

yeah the hoser shit got kinda old and there s so much of it that kinda got funny again which i kinda enjoyed 

moranais and thomas really executed it really well here 

what else do i have to say about hake 

i was like  i hope he s big when he s a kid and not finding that sweet piece of hidden art that was important to him  so i kinda believe him 

so yeah  it wasn t a great feat of a cinematic whatever  but it s definitely a high 3 two minute pisses on a looney bin 

thank you reif for bringing this up 

last time we saw this was in reif s basement when we were 16 or 17  especially that first one in the dark going super crazy  iconic in my brain 

i always remembered it being really entertaining and really good 

now that i had the chance to watch it i was like  eh maybe it shoulda stayed in my brain where i thought it was 

i think it tries to be more entertaining than it executes 

honestly i think that s okay 

i wanted to know more about the world  i love that dystopian weird thing 

i think this coulda been a miniseries now and done really well instead of this movie 

so yeah 

uh  

when reif picked it last week i was like oooh sweet i get to give something a 5 

dont think that s right however i enjoyed this one dont need to be rational this gets 4 taye diggss faces on a marble floor 
i feel like for as long as ive known sam  he s recommended this film to me  if i was gonna be a honest i probably still have his dvd somewhere that he loaned to me at my parents house 

the part that while im mildely ashamed of not returning it  im more ashamed of having it over a decade and havent watched it til now 

i thought it was good  i was worried it was too good but there was a ton to talk about it we touched on magical realism i m here for full magic if we coulda bumped anything up bump that 

but no uh everything else mostly been said the cast was pretty cool i loved the vibe of the film it was super general 

ths is an easy pick of 4 poisonous morsel tartlets 
i can go next 

yeah i hadnt seen this movie in a really long time since i was a littl eone 

this was a delight to watch  i have a softspot for musicals 

the songs were much better than i remember them being 

loved the performance and just how absurd it was 

i was in the perfect mood to enjoy just how absurd it was 

been a while i give this score but im gonna give 5 glitter lilly funeral arrangements 

 nice 

i love this movie 

i think its crazy quotable 

i was really excited to have all yalls watch it 

kinda  a bummer we ddint get to watch this all together 

megs had seen this in pieces like how you watch it on tv 

so i sat on the floor in front of her and was looking at her and sayin  watch you think about that  and i was really annoying her all the time 

then i was like worried and nervous cause i love this movie and if my friends dont love this movie what if they think its bad and theres something i didnt see 

it was a great watch and added to a different level of excitement to the whole thing 

my kid brain filled in the holes that my adult brain didnt have and there was some issues with that and the dialogue was great

loved john candy talkin to maisy and miles and the innocence of their responses to his kinda goofballish kinda dopey adulthood i really love that 

it was kinda wholesome and held up to me 
so yeah this remains one of my favoirte movies this is a totally unsurprising 5 gnat circumcising hatchets 
cool 

so when shag picked this one i was pumped to get a chance to re watch this film that i knew i had seen it in the past 

when i watched it i didn’t realize how many scenes i had seen i had seen this a shitton  i memorized many scenes 

culturally this movie was huge  changed my perspective more than most films in general 

the one bummer was that i was hoping for more scenes that i had forgotten  not a knock on this film  its excellent really really good 

dont have much to say about it always fun to watch 4 bobs 
has a quick one he supposes 

was excited to watch this movie when it came out 

the fight scenes held up a lot  if i was anywhere near jaden smiths age when this comes out i woulda been a real hype on it for sure 

current johnson loved jackie chan  he s killing it in this role and bringing sweetness and care 

jaden smith seems like a weirdo in real life crushes this role  girl character is unnecessary kinda makes it weird 

she doesnt really work  the bad kid works great tho  really enjoyed that 

so yeah my biggest and only criticism of the film is its length  its too long and it kinda drags 

thats my only criticism  other than that the movie fuckin crushes 

thanks for bringing us back to this jord  gonna give 4 jackets up with attitude 
so i do feel like going into this movie with basement level expectations does this movie better 

certain things i really liked about it  i think there is a kernel of a story in here that is good 

i liked the aesthetic choice of gothic space ships   really cool all the gothic architecture  eddy redmayne making choices really great  i dont think that mila kunis can act and channing tatum stinks  they named the one elephant character  nesh  reference to indian god is fucking stupid 

the watchowskis were shooting for a space opera epic and it just came off muddy 

we just mentioned earlier that the matrix was crisp and in this every action scene was crazy blurry and hard to watch 

once again absolutely loved the conversation super stinky pile of shit movie i give this a 1 space rollerblades 
i m glad that i got to bring bollywood to mnc  i was really hoping to bring something new and fresh 

i think i did that  

the conversation was way more positive than i thought it would be 

this movie took me 3 nights to view because the baby 

the movie was a slog  these little pockets  reif mentioned erlier  that i was laughing   a lot 

the fact that this was a subtitle movie  meant you had to stay much more engaged than an english speaking movie that made it a little bit more arduous 

it had the tropes that    and the song and dance numbers were way to long but it was fun to have it 

i definitely enjoyed watching something that is outside my wheelhouse 

im glad that it was so kooky and bonkers

while this was not tremendously good  it was really fun and i enjoyed something that was totally bonkers new 

this is getting a 3 removed glasses  and i will put it in my review  this one will be one that we reference and mention way more in the future 

our low scores will probably be in it  
so i liked it for all the reasons we alreadysaid  i thought it was subtle 

or supple 

i like the japanese culture  so fun to play with  love the animation style 

my biggest gripe  happened a lot in this film  is that they reused animation over and over  such as dancing  exact same loops and then they come right back to it 

theres this one where he does this weird flip thing with his leg  and after i seen it the 15th time  it pulled me out of the film when they reuse the same thing over and over and over 

personal gripe  whatever didnt like it 

overall the conversation of this film prvoed that this was a great movie club pick that will sit in my brain for long long time

3 cursed elongated arms 
i don’t know if it was them not wanting to watch something about video games or what but they knew it was bad 

i could shit on this movie  but it does take swings 

i was excited because ryan picked this one  it had nostalgia that i got to see  it was a total mess of a movie 

it felt like cocaine and money thrown at the wall 

dont have a whole lot more to say about it 

i did fall asleep twice watching it 

for that i give this 2 screamin martini worms 
alright 

so i remember this movie somhow kinda coming out  i pretty sure i saw this movie i ntheaters  but my parents don’t remember so maybe it’s a false memory 

the first thing i read about this movie before watching it was that it was a childrens book 

this skewed how i interpreted this film  watching childrens books its snappy you gotta move place to place  who gives a shit about plotholes we trying to get to the end 

i forgave a lot of its shortcomings  of course the demolition explosion blast them into central park where they are supposed to go 

end was pretty intense for a little kid  enjoyed it  but was it a good movie  absolutely not  i dont score based on awards  accolates  critic approval  this is nothing lower than 4 circuses with a notion of spice 
i don’t know who the cohen brothers are  but i did hear about them one time 

i really loved the vibe all the way through  i didn t think it was boring 

i agree with the criticisms and i see them  but i didn’t notice them when i was watching it  the film did that for me 

i like these kinds of movies where it s confusion between characters adds compounds and creates solutions to conflict 

i really liked it so it gets 4 windowless curtains from me 
this film  i thought  was   i guesss i came into this with high expectations   but i though this was booooring 

unbelievable boring 

the acting lacked passion  and i just could not connect to the 1950s version of the future at all

i thought it was stupid 

yeah i dunno i just   i didn t connect with this movie for whatever reason and i didn t enjoy it

this gets a 1 chickenshitunmichaelphelpslike swimmy bois 

i entered this movie not realizing it was a comedy  and clint eastwood went in not realizing this was a comedy  so that was a little weird 

for movie night club  yes it was too long but there was just enough absurdity that i was getting really excited to go and talk about it with you guys 

it ticked a lot of the boxes that i like to tick for a movie night club movie 

i was not upset to watch this film  but i wont watch the sequel 

i will rate this 3 pissen  shittin  fartin and ass pickens
