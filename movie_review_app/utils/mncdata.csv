The Woman,Sam,"I slightly disagree I guess, but I don’t disagree with the negative things said I guess. First time same as this time. I do keep coming back to one thing I oculd go on an don I do agree with this being heavy handed. The subject matter was not treated delicately enough. I complain a lot on this podcast.

Jordan: Just for us.

Sam: I complain about movies not being interesting anymore. Done by committee. you don tsee the personality of the creator coming through. I do think this movie was interesting. I was entertained. Felt like tuning in. I felt like there was a lot about it that made it worth watching. Im gonna do a hot take. Three eaten hearts in a hand.",3
Phantasm Two,Sam,"its an experience I had a lot fun with it. You know I split these movies into two. I was very much looking forward to watching the second part.

jordan: bless up king

i picked this movie off the dome. its a bit of a bornig pick. nice fun pick. everyone gonna like it. thinking about when w were going to be watching it, something a little more easily digestible might be the ticket. you can then copy and paste what shag said, its exactly how i feeel. its kind of a perfect little doc in a lot of ways. like figure skating, theres a level, gymnastics, theres a level of difficulty for your routine. you need higher difficulty for a 5. not a lot of threads, arcs or any of that. it can't be a perfect score, so, im gonna just complete the package. 4 types of people who are the type of dog to bite back.

Election,Sam,"ive said pretty much everything I wanted tos ay about this moovie. This is 5 juicy fruits out of a fishbowl. I fuckin loved this movie. The era made it so that it felt weirdly nostalgic. Felt it with too wong foo. When you watch a movie from the 90s youve never seen before and you enjoy it. so fuckin funny and th emoral complexity was so interesting and balanced so well.

cant believe i havenot seen it before gonna take 5 juicy fruites from that fishbowl.",5
Party Monster,Sam,"gotta disagree with my esteemed collegue hake. By all metrics iw ould use to judge acting, mck and seth green doing a bad jorb.

This movie fascinated me in a way I cant describe. I was tuned in. I talk all the time about weirdness and unique choices and i complain about movies not making those choices. you cant show me a movie with more weirdness and more just like... doing whatever the fuck it wants so....

on paper this one is a 3, in my heart its a 5. this averages out to 4: money
fame
success
glamours

Gone in 60 Seconds,Sam,"as a newbie to this film called gone in 60 seconds, I have had a few experiences like this where you watch something from the era we grew up in and I feel like I missed it not seeing it as a kid. This just slots right in to like my, era where like my comfort movies come from. i dont mind some of the early 2000s uglyness. objectively some of it is kinda gross.

it was just so much fun and tightly constructed. lots of moving parts that come together really well. similar to oceans 11 that i really liked. gotta give it 4 lazer cut poopy dog keys that i get my jollys off with. thats the score i ma give with it.",4
Dangerous Liaisons,Sam,"comin in hard like a shotgun shot.

I thought we were having fun dangerously liasons together. I thougth we were having a dangerous liason and building to some sexy interesty naughty times.

Istead we just get mired in this stodgy bullshit melodrama that just got me so bored. hake is saying all the words in my head.

bored bored bored fuckin so bored. i wanna give it 1 double johnmalkovichwid. but cause i sex my wife i give 2.

jordan: thats so fuckin hot.",2
Diamonds Are Forever,Sam,"*sam takes his shirt off*

this was fun. Like others have said. This was a fun coconut to crack into to sllurp ut app of its andioxidants water.

Comes close to so bad its good territory but ultimatesly falls short. The films that fall into that category have a thread of insanity to them and internal logic that is bizzarre and confounding but just sucked into the movie.

this is not 1 insane. this is a collection of insane jammed together some internaning most boring and drawn out.

i dunno, i dont think

watching bond is sherry from 100 year old wine casks this is scraping the bottom of the barrel for crusty wine skins. This movie Sucks Dick.

Im gonna give it 1 thirsty butthole.",1
The Bad News Bears,Sam,"ill provide the counter point and im going to give this movie…. A score after I talk about it.

*sips beer*

I was prepared to come in here and give this 2 cruds.

Base offa my experience with it.

Primarily because I was just a littl ebit bord with it. i realize that was just a production issue.

becem more interesting listening to what was said. i was in a shitty mood when i watched it.

i still think it drags a bit a ttimes but if i read the script it would pop more than i saw. bump fro 2 to 3

The Neon Demon,Sam,"*shirts off*
okay I got my shirt off ready to the review of the movie.

Unlike jordan I was very much in the mood for this movie.

To look at some slow burn imagery and connect the dots at my liesure.

I was predisposed to be generous, but, talkin bout it with you guys obviously its become clear that any leeway i wanted to give the plot was me just wanting to give it that. um.

i always feel like ive already said everything i wante dto say and i gotta be honest speak to my experience and give it 3 trifectas if that FUCKIN SONG DIDNT SUCK SO BAD AND MAKE ME DROP IT TO 2 trifectas of cannibalizm.",2
Crocodile Dundee,Sam,"*takes shirt off*
I could't get my shirt off.

In austrailian accent:

I watched the movie ""crocodile dundee* and I said ""get stuffed!

This movie was kind of a bit more boring than I expected.

Fish out of water, maybe I mixed up some action that didnt happen some silly shit that didnt happen.

in retrospect just talking abou tit and talking about how it is your enjoyment of th emovie is baout how much you are charmed by paul hogan this movie goes doen in like a cold fosters i have to give it a 4 cold fosters blown off a cupples.",4
Beavis and Butt-Head Do America,Sam,"*takes off shirt*

ok ive got my shirt off and im ready to rate the movie. Um 
this shit mostly bored me. I feel like I probably just don’t get bevis and butthead. Everything I like about this movie is then done in king of the hill, non main characters, the hyper realism thats kinda gross. similar humor but in king of the hill its funny and a little heart just enough to carry a plot. and that just isnt here for this movie.

i was mostly bored by it. i have to bump it up 1 because of the soundtrack. the soundtrack is my life. for that reason i gotta give it 2 couplalilolespirdermunkeys

5 failed cigarettes failed by the rolled kevin clikne.

Lemme tell you why. Oh lemme explain. the score i just gave it

Im about as primed as anyone could be seeing this movie but as i said noone see dis before

this was a time when i was rebelling against sfuf i had grown up with highschool

this was the year where i had the least interest in the stuff that my parents raised me on, phc was number 1 on my list.

okay they makin a movie who fuckign cares wat a buncha looosers.

last night, it was just a rebound effect. i was just flooded with stuff i hadnt realized so important this show as to my upbringing helped to break movie up into two nights. by the end ofth efirst night watching it was getting board tbh

it was a lil too much every singel seen is too much comin at you and i was kinda ready to be done about 50 mins in but splitting into two helped.

i alwasy gotta rate from my personal experience this show was 5 times he tryin to light it. 5 times he tryin to light it. 5 times he cant.

Jordan: who's that?

Same: talking about it with you gues. i just love it. the cinemaphotogrphyy so many great jokes and good performances.

Not a 5 on paper but a 5 in my heart.

Who?

Rolled by THE kevin kline.",5
Django,Sam,"lemme get in here.

burpsssss

um. Alright. This is a classic example of high highs and low lows.

I was having a ton of fun but like reif mentioned earlier on like kinda dropped off in the second half and kinda just... the sound design was. absurdly bad at points, to the point of making me check out.

but at the same time, django's really shootin dese guys so i gotta give it 3 coffins filled with machine guns but now is filled with gold. i gotta say django was really shootin this guy.

he was using the beautiful art invented by christian bale of ""guncata""

okay cherry poppin daddies. Ew gross

metropolis. Zoot suit riiots in metropolis. Break a bottle of beer.

Lot of fun getting dvd in the mail. just like, a movie i anticipated watching a lot. i hadnt really heard of it before. i maybe heard about it but conflated with metropolis, the more famous movie.

i was very excited to watch it but ended up being very disappointed.

it doesnt take much to get me on board with a high concept speculative sci fi. a good story that would be great.

you dont want to give me that? you dont want to give me a tightly constructed narrative? thats fine.

just give me some interesting characters.

okay, you gonna give me rock with no backstory and retarted teema and uncle who's sun is getting fulshed through sewer system

how does this society fucntion, show me gears and cogs of the people so i can sink my teeth into that and it will be fine

No..?

thats fine.

i jsut need it to be really really cool to look at and aesthetically pleasing to me.

this almost ticked that box for me. some scenese tickled me a bit.

the cgi i dont want to hold that oo bad.

Mr. Jealousy,Sam,"*sam takes of tie*
*Takes off shirt*
Alright, mr jealousy.
Mr jealousy
mr jealousy

so I realized I don’t watch a lot of relationship dramas. A good one kinda hits me really hard.

Not necessarily emotionally. But the awkwardness, scenes where he's lying, being jelous. those scenes are viscerally painful for me.

it cuts through and gives me the feeling that i know what the scene ist rying to give but is not always present.

but when i am trying to watch one it can be a pretty intense experience.

i got this with this movie. i was really there with it. i was enjoying the comedy. i was being lenient with what i didnt like. i was watching it with rose tinted glasses.

this conversation brought me down in a way was needed. i enjoyed this film and am excited to seeing noah bombach film. and knowing zina is going through his stuff im excited. im at the start of a beautuful relationship with a director i dont know that much so 4 therapy sessions with bogdonbononivich alec boolyon bogdonovich peter bogdonovich",4

Monkey Bone,Sam,"*takes off shirt*

so.

*shows monkey bone*

I kinda thought I knew what I was in for. I thought this was some sort of shitty 2000s comedy I have seen a million of dem. Brendan frazier on his downswing.

Then the movie began to unfurl like an orchid and release its sweet scent.

by the time brendan frazier and dave foley were wearing matching silver suits and bob odenkirk and chris katan i was fully monkey boned up

theres a lot wrong with this movie, but what's right is tight and what's tight is fuckin tight.

the conversation we have helps to shape my score, but this shit was rubber stamped as soon as the credits rolled and dont let anybody stop me on chris katan kevin hake is the most exciting new voice in movie night club and fresh young exciting virulent kevin hake sexy voice in movienight club. 5 organs from chris katan.

DRUK (Another Round),Sam,"*keeps it low key*
last season was too horney, I retire from stripping.

I really loved this film I was just very touched by the dislpay of male friendship and was very, provoked, from a thought perspective by the nuanced take on alchohol and your relationship with alchohol and how it can deteriorate your life in a lot of circumstances.

i thought he toke was so interestingly spry, throughout. when ive heard discussions about whether or not this was a comedy and couldnt see why this was up in the air and then tommy fuckin... got eaten' by sharks. this is such a dramatic film until the end. 4 with a point in front for my B.A.C.

*fakes injury*

respiro. I don’t have a lot interesting to say about this movie that I havent already said. I was enjoying it scene by scene a lot more than i did the macro vision. my enjoyment of it was very very high, partially because of the filmmaking skikll of moldovar.

its a movie presented as a mindfuck that holds your hand the whole time. interesting dichotomey if you were to explain someone spell it out. but they just kinda tell you everything that is happening as it is happening.

doesnt make me feel any particular way whatsoever.

loved this conversation, was very activating, very stimulating. the film itself i gotta give it 3 non-consentual vaginal plasties.",3
Sorcerer,Sam,"let me build off of that with a review.

So jumping of what my collegue jordan said, expounding on what he had to say. I also liked movie.

I don’t hav ea lot else to say that I havent already said. I was in it scene to scene, for sure.

i wasnt really thinking about the macro stuff, for the vibe.

tonight some of the questions i hadnt cared to answer came to the forefront. my enjoyment in retrospect was not same as in the time.

i started closer to where jordan ended up, i was knocked down a lot by the conversation, start maybe a 4, knocked down to a 2, but then i was forced to buy this movie. cant justify buying 8 daollars for i fascniens aside its probably a 3 for me i really enjoyed it might watch it again tonight. not going to defend it but going to defend it. 3 drips of nitroglycerine",3
Shogun Assassin,Sam,"Im glad I didn’t prepare much. It would have been a cherry on top of hakes cherry that he already provided and popped.

I kind of watched it at the end of the day and was not super enthused. I was more bored with it than I thought. I was worried it was kind of boring for you dudes.

i was worried kinda to talk about how this movie doesnt bear rewatching and goign through it the second time lost its lustre and then hake went through and said watching it time 2 was the tightest shit ever. i was gonna choose 3 swords but the conversation brought me up to choosing 4 swords.",4

after watching this movie was was worried you guys were gonna be mad because it was boring at parts.

This is the first movie that i picked not knowing much about it, other than having mentioned the title probably 700 times in my life as a joke.

i was super worried, aw shit this sucked, people gonna think this is borning. this conversation was fun.

it reminded me a bit of jupiter ascending, picking this shit apart. there was such a poorly made movie to stick our fingers in the seems and pry them open and shit in and rub the shit in and smell it and think it was fuckin cool.

*jordan* is this the tom arnold bit?

I think john waters would agree and that’s me im john waters and im doing my perfect john waters voice

it felt like watching hi to you or lemon party like the fun fun internet movies i watch as a child

this has culturualy value to this movie in 1972 but that movie has disippated.

i was fully prepared to not appreciated it or watch it or, i wasnt looking forward to watching it and it drew me in whether i liked it nort.

this is the movie im looking for in movie club.

it scratches the itches im scratchin with james bond and action and 70s black culture asthetic it goes down smooth for me

Mallrats,Sam,"Difficult for me to review this movie objectively, because this was one of the frist really good comedy movies where I was old enough to understand what was goin on.

It was basically portraying my brothers generation, It was what I looked up to, so cool, expected it to be boring or overly problematic.

instead i was having so much fun, the movie hums along from scene to scene even with jeremy london delivering flat lines.

when the movie is not funn, which it is a lot of time time when it was not funny it was having fun and i just feel like.

i feel like ther ewas not a 5 minute point in the movie where i was bored or starting to look at my phone.

i had a fucking blast this was awesome im gonna give it 4 chocolate coverated stink palms.

given my review can be dangerous business.

pretty much in agreement with hake:

I was havin fun, and I wasn’t havein fun. I was swinging wildly like a 1 to a 4 in this movie. there was a lot of potential but it was hard to susse out the pie that tasted like shit.

mostly tasted like shit, like blue chips. i was pretty harsh on and didnt give a great score. i would be bustin my shit at garey buseys antics (mcnulty (nick nulty)).

I sort of came at this from the opposite angle of some of my esteemed collegues.

I was really having fun out fo the gate. Not expecting to to be good and giving it a lot of leeway. i was enjoying it scene by scene, while leetting some fo the macro aspects ssort of wash away and not beinportant to me.

nejuoning the scene and feeling steeped in a sort of vibe that makes me feel nostolgaic makes me feel nostailci as one of part of my life at any part in in time.

i liked the conciet, the sci-fi worldbuilding was good. part of not liking time travel is i turn my brain off when it happens.

i was just enjoying the scenes and trusting that it all fits together.

I think I know how I feel from a aratings perspective. 

Theres a lot of spinning gears like stuff lost in translation, how much leeway do you give it being under the iron curtain, the whole speaking truth to power thing is not just an art movie thing... thats an everymovie thing.

viel of communist russia has a crooks being baddies and cops being goodies.

performances were funny and seeing soviet russia on film is kinda cool and kinda fun.

People love detective batman, and that's great, but I love ninja batman. This batman seems a little clumsy. He is too human. Shag will tell you, you don't want vulnerable human stories, you want big ninja stuff. I love this movie. As a kid, you have the same junk food over and over and stop because it just loses its ability to give you the same pleasure and that is how DC stuff is for me. I used to watch it over and over and now it doesn't hit the same way. So,, no hot take gotta give 4 bat-a-rangs. I'll take what I used to feel and mix it with what I feel now. 5 then, 3 now, so 4.

Victor/Victoria,Sam,"of the dome here we go. I broke the 2 minute barrier right before we got on tonight. Wanted you guys to know, this is when you pee for over 2 minutes straight.

When I started peeing, my lower abdomen looked like there was an alien inside of it. And it was fuckin crazy. 2 minutes and 9 seconds approximatly.

we went out to dinner and it was a long drive back but it got uromysotisis poisoning.

now onto da movies. i had such a fun time watchin this.

i was really really busy the last few days and had to squeeze this in awkward segments and that can affect the enjoyment of the movie.

i agree with some of the criticisms of the movie and would not have brought up on my own like a coward but i get the criticism.s

i love old school entertainers and musicals, and also they can be a drag, and this gave us a little hit of what i like about musicals and just being a pretty funny comedy without a lot of the music driving the story, but largely its a funny tapdancing comedy.

i love julie andrews and havent really seen her in much but mary poppins and i fuckin loved this movie i fuckin lvoed it, i gotta fuckin give it 5 small rages who was small rages norma 5 small rages from norma norma's small rages!

i was going to do four and started talking about the movie and im like no, i dont give a fuck! i love this movie.",5
Drop Dead Gorgeous,Sam,"here I got.

This shit was hot out the gate for sure.

I was belly laughing early and often, really having a great time. I felt pretty confident that I knew what I was in for, and that confidence continued for most of it perobably the first hour, but i feel like after the pageant really shoulda been wrapped up after the pageant.

everything was really fine after the pageant felt really untidy that seemed unnecessary, there was a good movie there that could have been wrapped up in minessota.

i had a blast with this movie, but those were issues.

all the retard stuf, anorexic stuff, peodophile stuff not great. gonna give 3 melted beercanhands. maybe in 3 months ill be at a 5.

Im looking forward to a rewatch of this film.

The American Astronaut,Sam,"this was. Experietial. I dunno I have so many films on my list that I know im gonna love that are gonna be really well put together packages and great stories…

in many ways I come to movie club to be forced to watch shit that  I wouldn’t ordinarly see otherwise.

i struggled with this and was trepedatious about what i was getting into, once i got ready to let it wash over me, i was having a lot of fun.

this is going to stick with me, it was a unique experiecne and the more i do it the more i value the weird ass singular experiences over tightly constructed packages.

my take is lukewarm 3 little ciggies. i liked this one, thassit.",3
Bones,Sam,"*takes shirt off*

we're back with the boys.

I have my shirt off and im gonna do my review now of the movie.

So this was a confusing one. What a perfect selection to kick off boys only movie club lifetime.

I was having a lot of fun for most of the movie, and in talking about it i think i gaslit myself into enjoying this movie more than I should have.

thinking about the plot made me angry and have criticisms cause they tried to do too much. there was a lot there and that kinda makes me upset.

there was potential in multiple directions and they tried to pursue them all an ddidnt stick the landing for any of them.

i think snoop did a good job but i gotta do 2 maggot rainhouses.",2
Zombi 2 (Zombie Flesh-Eaters),Sam,"so I can offer a rebuttal to the garbage that I just heard spill out of someones trashole that the call a mouth when they say the music is mostly the detriment.

This was my favorite sountrack. The soundtrack is so sloppy and analogue. If you like sorcerer but not like tangerine dream.

you can telll its some dude with his old ass synths just some crazy weirdo doing this at his studio in the vatican or somethin.

i will agree that the gore is good sort of, its visceral it hits you.

and thats it, the rest of it was so trash and so boring and like i don't really want to get into it because there was very little that I liked about it.

it was a decent set up but just the sloggiest poorlyiest petered out and it was all over.

Tales From the Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood,Sam,"ill be short maybe.

i. uh. I like metaphors.

You go to a restaurant and you get the menu and you are pretty excited to order, all the ideas of the dishes are good like:

im gonna watch this dennis miller tales of the crypt like low stakes and stupid.

what it was was boring and drab and the asparagus was overcooked, some of the stuff on the menu didnt show up in the dish.

it didnt work, which doesnt always piss me off, but if it had worked i think i woulda enjoyed it. i guesss i gotta gvie it 2 pussy trains to stinky station.

i hated dennis miller. i was glad it was short.",2
Possession,Sam,"Johnson: higher than the piece of garbage ""The American Astronaut""

Sam: I sign some of those songs to myself in my head.

It was science! And Anthropology.

Second time watching this, was able to sort of relax. This was one of the best rewatch experiences I've had.

I feel like it gives you the ability to let go, from a narrative perspective.

i just wasnt stressing too hard how you get there.

which was good. i just had like alll my final projects due monday, and I've been more stressed than I have been for as long as I can remember.

This was a really great dark experience because I've been in a dark mindset, and it was cool to watch it suffer me and after the movie i felt like shit and was really strung out and in a bad mindset.

i knew i was going to start feeling better in a few days, so I was just gonna let it tug me around a bit because I knew i would be safe where it takes me. sort of not really that safe it hurts.

i think watching it a second time, you can set yourself up for an experience that is really moving in a way that was inexplicable.

that's what i want from an arthouse film. i don't have a ton of criticisms of this movie im gonna give it 4 trash feathers.",4
Misery,Sam,"you are the captain now.

Look at me I am giving the reivew now.

Good movie.

Should I say more?

Um. I fucking love this movie. It kind of is not a similar movie but it gives off a similar vibe as roesmary's baby like a horror movie that doesn’t hit you over the head with its horror movie.

it is light and breezy to watch. it just suprises you with some of the violence but ultimately its contained and tight and well written and the tone is easily digestible. that's rob schneider. he makes tight little packages. at least he did at the time.

i gotta give this one 5 lil bitchly cow corns.

after the first time i watched it, i knew i loved it. its gotta be in my top 10 horror movies of all time.",5
Someone's Watching Me!,Sam,"I am undecided. Let this review pour forth from my mmmmmmmouth.

I am really conflicted about this one because I love carpenter and I feel this movie was missing a lot that I liked about the score and the body horror stuff and violent aspects, like the sexuality was missing a bit.

i did love the portrayal of a genuinely strong protagonist in the late 70s. i like a mystery. don't feel like it panned out super convinceingly.

the ride felt a bit like her apartment, a little beige. my expectations skewed how i view the movie it was a bit weird and skewed in that carpenter way but it was cookie cutter with parts that i genuinely liked.

this conversation made me see it more positively than i did going into it. i give it 3 grabbed shards of glass. glabbed sharbs of window. 3 grabbed window shards

3 almost glabbed shards of grabs.",3

I usually watch these movies in the evening *oo my drink* in two stints. and it has contributing to me being most positive reviewer.

i set myself up for short stints, in a good mood, pretty relaxed, willing to give myself over to the movie.

i see things in a slightly more positive light.

we had to fit this in afternoons. kinda busy. when it happens i assume that im just gonna enjoy it less.

that didnt fuckin happen at all, this shit drew me in immediately.

in love with the shitty low rent aesthetic. what im lookin for is to go with it earnestly and give me the experience that its coming from just one phsyco going for everything.

Okay so, heres what I hab to say about du moobie. I was um, very excited about noir aesthetic, but I haven't seen that many movies.

A lot of stuff im into borrows but it’s a blindpot for me that I would like to fill in to scratch that itch.

havent seen orsen welles movies, including citizen kane. interested in him as an actor but dont know about his performance.

I don’t like this movie.

It also was a thinker.

And a STINKER!

I saw this movie as a kid. I saw it on TV on comedy central or TNT and picked it up as it came. I knew it was gonna suck.

I forgot to write a song.

ive got an idea. I'm gonna get an extension and turn in two decent assignments next week.

maybe that's why ive been dissociating and putting hentai on the screen.but

i knew this was gonna fuck this im gonna do my own song.

i knew it was gonna be bad. but i thought it would be fun. i was certain this would be fun.

it was joyless.

all you really want for this is for the lead to be really charismatic and to carry the story even if it sucks and chris tucker and orlando jones to do this thing and be in a dumb shit movie.

So I Married An Axe Murderer,Sam,"
*burps*

I think yall were a lil hard on the mikey.

Some of the takes I was hearing were wild. And wrong.

Mike meyers schtick is old and aged poorly. When you let go to treat it like modern material it is charming.

It is good and everyone who got pissed about it like, comon this is a time capsule of the movie.

the movie is a valid breezy little flick, its not trying too hard to be anything mind blowing or subversive but ultimately it boils down to mike meyers annoying the shit out of you.

i think mike meyers has amazing chemistry by the sea and flirty for the first time with the russian sailors. there are times where this really fits the bill of a romantic comedy, exactly what you would want from it.

maybe this movie works for me and why i chose it, this shit slaps.

mike meyers is annoying, that's for real.

I was havin so much fun the first half were both laughin a lot. really kinda down with the bizarre flow of things, imperfect things i didnt like that i liked. every thing that sucked was charming.

the second half i was having such a bad time with it i had to question if i was in a shitty mood, like that will happen some times.

i came to the conclusion that i was wrong. no im in a great mood and this shit is a slog and bummin me out. an interesting experience overall which is all you can ask for in a movie club

I watched the moobie. And now ill talk about it.

It will begin… now:

I… got home today after a bunch of mini clincal hours and this was not really the vibe I was looking for, which was fine.

This was a perfect storm of being in right head space to enjoy this film.

maggie gylenhaal is pretty wonderful in some of the spots in this film... the black comedy works, is so dark as to beintersting.

the strangeness is enough to keep you off balance the entire way, which is potentailly interesting as long as it makes good on that uneasyness, as long as it gives you something to make sense of what you just watched.

i think this movie shits the bed at the end. i thought this movie stunk it was stinking up the whole house as i was watching it i gotta give it 1 brush spanks in the bafroom.

Billy Campbell

Billy Campbell should be blacklisted from hollywood.

this is opposite world because jordan watched 2 takes and i watched 1.

I was wearing a watch and it hurt and was itcy, and then i had an infected cut under my watch. with red lines branching down my arm. staph infection.

internet told me to go to see medical care, and i got antibiotics and im fine.

The Perfect Host,Sam,"its not like have anything mooch to say but im gonna say it.

I already mentioned the two tones of the xperience watching this movie.

After the first half I was ready to go. I was pretty excited I didn’t know whwere it was gonna go. I twas gonna be a tour deforce by david allen pierce.

i and i was like whatever happens him doin his thing theres gonna stay in the house and twists in the house and then the second half stretch itself and strech itself and try to be something more than that with every attempt it makes to expand the mystery box. the mystery box is actually made of pringles and its full of shit!

and its actually what you found it out its a puddle of lidless pringless shithouse.

Throw Momma From the Train,Sam,"fam, I could review the movie to be perfectly honest fam.

Gonna go off king.

Not surprising based on my comments. I didn’t feel as quite as warm as fuzzy as some of my esteemed collegues. Did

I fuckin hated this movie. This movie was stinky trash. billy crystol was miscast and danny devito was miscast. people bringing up good lines and yeah there wer some funny parts.

just the farce they were going for felt very farced. like the repeated fakeouts like we dont need a minute buildup of danny devito not killing his mom.

didnt really care what was going on. didn't feel sympathy for danny devito. felt like he was a dangerous sketchy individual.

didnt think there was any sort of kinship between billy kristol and didnt like it certainly didnt love it, 1 coffee table novel books that are most filled with the women I gotta pork.

hake mentioned the straight guy thing. that stuck with me. they are both kinda being stright men.

i loved it even though we moved on from it.

i think this works because noone is being too wacky or biting too down onnit. even scene with daughter, this movie is finessing its way through the plot that would nornally be a hammy slapsticky comedy so i gotta give 4 non-counterfeit counterfiet counterfit non-counterfiet twentyes.

i did agree with every criticism of the movie.

i feel complicit in its being brought forth, and i remember loving it when we watched it and having our minds blown.

i think jordan brings up a good point in the so bad its good or so bad its worthless category. i think there's a reason why its so stuck in my head and not much about its poignency, something going on in the sauce that tastes a way in that it's worth slurping down three taye digg's faces on the floor.

This movie does kinda present itself in a way… where you can see parents showing it to their kids and then being like ""what the fuck"" this thing is eating parts of this person.

that really tickled me this time. this sort of fun puppety carefree element mixed with the darker comedic elements.

i had a wonderful time watching this. the vibe was very unique. johnson brought up how when musicals dont try to be too realistic when they are filmed and try to keep the stage atomesphere when they are filmed.

Conversations like this I find myself not being able to figure out how I feel, and I still don’t think I know how I feel.

Being bored is not always bad in the context of a film. When I am being bored I don't remember if that means my enjoyment comes from it or for the most part I will rewatch it at some point like shag.

rewatch reaction.

Mostly I enjoyed seeing cohen attempts and they got better later.

lots of movie, gotta be bored myself and say 3 curtainless windows.

Gattaca,Sam,"I don’t have anything interesting to say.

I find it difficult to talk about the quality of this movie. I usually have very strong reactions when watching a movie that just I let guide me, ecause im not a critic.

I really didn’t feel that way watchign this movie.

there was a lot that i nitpicked that just sort of made me took em out of the world like the way they chose to pick scifi and dry stage acting style not working

i dunnno i was expecting this to be a lot more interesting and dynamic than it was and it ended up feeling stale tome.

Every Which Way But Loose,Sam,"sam
as is tradition, let me start it off.

I gotta be honest, we were shitting on the movie a lot, and I didn’t feel particularly defensive of it.

But my experience was very positive. Very low stakes movie, anything I think to bring up as a reason why i liked it, im on record like saying ""that sucked""

music was terrible
acting was bad
casting was bad

but the vibes were right. im kinda a vibes guy, if you dont know me.

i gotta give it 3 pissing shitting fucking monkey buns.

ummm alright so I watched this right before 4pm basically I didn't give it the attention it needed. I absolutely loved it. loved the soundtrack. loved the aspect that shaggy said about ""The Last Dance"". We need to film this dude because he is so dominant at the peak of his career. he was the governor of California! I cant wait to download the playlist and play it for my friends when they come over and have it play in the back ground and for them to be like what?! So good so good. really solid all around. I think if I was in a better viewing environment . I will give it four dogs by dogs.... dogs who fight instead of rolling over.

Election,Ben,"
uh, ok so first of all let me go to my notes because honestly i loved this move and agree with Sams comments. loved the wardrobe and how everything felt normal. They pushed 90s the way i would dress. Its Nebraska too which is like behind the times but not old timey. Pretty much all the characters except Paul have huge character flaws. Everyone loves Paul because he's a loveable guy. He wasn't too cynical. The movie was cynical but it was broken up by shots. The bee sting that becomes a fixture on his face and the peeing on the tree are so fucking funny. They live in normal life and these are abnormal behaviors. He moves to NYC and he's not crushing it, like how Tammy goes to catholic school. Giving the review right now has changed my opinion and it was a 4 but now I'm giving it a 5 juicy fruits out of a fishbowl.

Jordan: Thats a 5 toothpazed if I've ever heard one.

Reif: it was so fucking good. I was surprised at every moment. I thought it was going to be about a presidential election but it kept surprising

Gone in 60 Seconds,Ben,"I like malort, like other people hate it, but I drink it so frequently that I’ve grown to like it.
I haven’t been in that room that smells like farts in a while and I walked into this room that smelled like farts. I had nostalgia goggles when I recommended this movie. I remember watching this with my brother, David, on Starz. I probably watched this 10-15 times in high school, and we would get hype on it. To be honest it didn’t quite do it for me this time around. There were times when I was hype on it. The heist was really good. When I was 12 or 13 or whatever, it made me feel like this movie was smarter than it really was, like why would they steal 50 cars in 1 night. Like why wouldn’t they give them more time. I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt. But no, this movie is just really dumb. It’s not going to be a smart movie, but I thought it was. When Nick Cage plays a yuppie asshole to get a fancy car, that was pretty funny. The low rider son was pretty tight. When he said the car parts to get ugly Ange (part 1)

Angelina to have sex with him was pretty cool. When he jumped over all those cars with that face it was so funny. I had to keep rewinding it over and over to see his face. This movie had some good qualities but mostly bad qualities. I’m gonna have to give it 2 lazer cut poopy dog keys that I get my jollies off with. (part 2)

Dangerous Liaisons,Ben,"I think I kind of waffled around a lot about what I was going to give this movie. It gets points on being a period piece and Allison and I enjoyed it together. This was enjoyable to watch even though there were some parts that were not enjoyable, like the rape. It felt out of place for what the movie was going for. Nice Job, Malkovich. Did Weinstein have any part in this, it felt like it had his grubby fingers all over it. 1 double wigged Malkovich.

Diamonds Are Forever,Ben,"I’ve seen one full Sean Connery movie, it’s the one where he goes scuba diving. It’s classic bond. I watched it, but don’t remember much. The first 45 mins to an hour was really sucking me in. The last hour I was not distracted at all. It was great to have on in the background. The actors gave up. The plot wasn’t great quality. It is the perfect movie to have on when you have to do something. Every time I looked at it, I was like “What the fuck is happening” I don’t think that is a good trait for a movie to have. It was so unengaging. That is not what movies are for. I give this one of the Patty O’Tooles tittes on the moon buggy.
",1
The Bad News Bears,Ben,"So, lets see here. I think everything I wanted to say I said during the conversation. Allison and I enjoyed the movie a lot. A lot of nuance and to me attention to detail to not trying to explain everything to the audience. Used visual story telling so that the audience should get the joke unless they’re stupid or if the audio was bad. I do agree with Sam about the sound mixing or design (no one would explain it to me, and if they did I would forget it because ya know). But, if it weren’t for that I would have given it a 5 but I’m giving it 4 cruds.

The Neon Demon,Ben,"Vampire Covenant Review:
(lots of pre Reif vampire chit chat)
Reif: When she gets bit by skelator, vampires hate weirwolves and that’s why she hates her.
(continued vampire/weirwolf chat)
Skinny pete was pretty nice to her. He got the bat to protect her. I was excited to watch this because I liked Drive. We watched the trailer and it was like All right! We’re gonna watch this. Starts off interested with the wide angle and the blood on her. Then a slow pan on like a dolly pan. So you know what youre getting into with the slow music. You know there is going to be some super natural in it with a big reveal. The suspense is building in me. Every scene I am ready for the vampires and witches and spell casting. There was a lot there if you are looking for it, which I definitely was, obviously. Skelator eating the eyeball was tight, but it would have been way cooler if Elle Fanning climbed out of her, but none of that happened. I have to give this 1 Trifecta Cannable. Also, there was some real horrifying scenes, and not in a way I am into. I never had to look away before, but that scene with Keanu and the knife was fucked up dude. I hated it. I hated this movie. I wanted to like it. I hated it.

Crocodile Dundee,Ben,"Reif: People got some words tonight. You ready Johnson? Ok. So, um I pretty much 100% agree with Shag. I really liked the thoughts Jordan put down. I really liked what Johnson was saying. This whole conversation and movie were fun for me and Allison to watch. The one thing, the scene that was problematic, the build up to it, like you didn’t want it to happen, then when it has that type of scene, I feel like I can give it a pass, like the context and the time. I can’t 100% give it a pass. Without that scene I would have given it a 5. But with it, they could have made it fun without being a dick about it. In retrospect nobody wants to be a dick, none of my friends want to be a dick. I want to give it a 5, but I just can’t. I gotta give it 4 shooting frothies offa good boys. Sometimes I look it up and try my best to remember what to say, but…. Remember shooting dresses offa maids from Hakes like a month ago, its like the same visually. Well, that’s what I got.

Beavis and Butt-Head Do America,Ben,"Sam: Show him your unit. Man reif when you are writing shit I am saying it makes me so subconsious, like I’m a dumbass.
Jordan: I never look at it
Sam: Good god do I need to be making him write this out.
Jordan: Why am I giving a 4-paragraph review of Beavis and Butthead
Sam: Johnsons ready to go
Reif: Well it definitely disappointed me. I was expecting more. Allison got board and I was like “dang it this is boring”, and it bummed me out. It could have done much more. It had bright moments like rollercoaster of love and the sex jokes. The sphinx with her tits out was good slapstick humor. The psychedelic scene was good too. They missed some animation frames which was lazy as fuck and it annoyed me. They should have spent more money on animation. I was disappointed in it. I’ll have to give it 1 half of 2 spider monkeys jumbling about.

A Prairie Home Companion,Ben,"Im just going to watch while I.. Lets see what you got johnson. Ummmmmmm, I really liked this movie. I agree with Sam except that he was rebelling in HS but I was conforming. If I had the option to watch this with my parents, I wanted to be a part of what was meaningful. I think a huge part of that was crazy too just thinking about it. getting that stree fracture senior year, thinking about it was stuipd, but pumping iron with sam was extremely meaningful in my life. It changes the trajectory of your life. I may have gone to the Naval academy. i think that I would still be a good person, but acompletely different person. If i saw this in high school I'd give it a 5. But now, I'd give it 4 failed rolled cigerettes by the Kevin Kline.

Joran: I was injured too.

Sam: It was special to me too. I was in your face because I wanted you to train and be on the team.

Reif: I joined the XC team in the summer, I had an agreement with joe if i ran to the practice I could be on the team. I'm on the soccer team. I was running 4 miles every day dude, then doing a 3 hour soccer practice. 

Jordan: The plex was not 4 miles away.

Sam: The plex and shoaff are all connected by",4
Django,Ben,"Yea I think that everything that has been said before has been said. Maybe if I watched it with headphones. I agree with the content of Jordan's words but not the score. I don’t really like westersn, but I do like tombstone. I like Vval Kilmer, especially in Masked & Anonymous. So I mean I fell asleep during this movie. I feel like the could have had more character stuff and the machine gun toward the end. That would have been more my style. All the characters are single facet which is exciting because the characters are all one thing. Like the general gun slinger and woman with a dark past. That was tight. The sound design was so difficult for me to get immersersed. I wanted to enjoy it but I didn't enjoy it all that much. I had a score in mind watching it, I felt unsure about that score. I agree about my unsuredness about the score. I give it a 2 coffins that was filed with machine guns but it is now filled with gold.

I don't think it deserves a 1. I feel like if the sound design was... if I had headphones, it felt so samey. It was all these gun battles. I felt like I couldn't get a sense of weight or a connection with the characters.

Metropolis,Ben,"Sometimes people catch fire in a review and it’s great. But by the end I can’t keep up. That was, Sam, you caught fire and were making jokes about moonraker or whatever and you were throwing down the funniest shit and I couldn’t write down anything.
Yea so, I’ve been really excited to watch this movie for 20 years. The first time I saw imagery from this film it captured my imagination. I spent portions of the past 20 years trying to find what movie that was from. Once I ID’d it, it became something I really wanted to watch like 10 years ago. Streaming wasn’t big then. You couldn’t buy it in a store. So I forgot about it for a while. Then I remembered it for movie night and I picked it and we watched it. We have been watching it in the basement for 1 weeks, but it feels like forever. We turn the lights off and sit on the couch. Putting a DVD in, you start it and let it ride. The visuals… I looked past the CGI. I feel like Ghost in the Shell, if they had handed off the CGI to animators it would have looked
better. I have experience with overlooking that. The visuals captivated me enough to propel me through the movie. The story is, ya know, if I was 18 it probably would have blown my puny little mind. Now it’s giving me nostalgia for the time when sci-fi was new and meaningfully transforming the way I looked at things. When she assimilates with the ziggurat and gives the ham fisted “humanity is fucked, I should destroy humans” I got a weird form of nostalgia. When I finished the movie it was definitely a 4 for me. It falls short in so many ways that it’s not a 5 but its definitely a 4. This movie took a beating tonight and Sam is a very honest critic. Hearing someone being critical of anime from a place that is fairly well constructed forethought was interesting because I didn’t have a negative reaction to it. It helped me come to terms that it didn’t live up to my expectations. I want to give it a 4, but I’m giving it a 3 Uncles that don’t give a shit about their nephews.

Mr. Jealousy,Ben,"I was actually talking about the score I was going to give it with my father-in-law and I wanted to know where to set up the computer. He was like, are you going to be painting during that time. It’s funny because I was painting during diamonds are forever. In general, I enjoyed the movie. Alison enjoyed it as well. I respect her opinion a lot. Sometimes my opinions come from a place that’s not complete. Alison is my canary in the coal mine. If she doesn’t like it… it might not be good. She was like “Wow this is really awesome.” I wasn’t interested in following this character around because he was a loser. This movie reminds me a lot of Avengers Infinity War. This is my moment to explain it. Avengers Infinity War is cool because the antagonist wins, but the antagonist is the protagonist from the other point of view. It has the other story structure but reversed. The other character, the protagonist, you don’t want to root for him. But, he still successfully accomplishes his goal. Thanos has some justification, and he wins. He accomplishes the thing he wants. Then I watch the guy who you hate win and accomplish his goals. It like mirrors it cause it’s the way mirrors work. Trying to read your shirt in a mirror doesn’t work because it’s backwards because its in a mirror. 4 Group Therapy Sessions with Peter Bogdanovich.

Mars Attacks,Ben,"I’ll be short. I don’t have a lot of strong opinions right now. I really liked this movie as a kid.  I was shocked the Martians just started killing everyone. I was really excited to watch this with Alison. It was a pretty cool reveal. The CGI was jarring, and the lighting wasn’t great. Hearing it would be a 100 million dollar film with puppets, but that money would go to pay a humongous team of artists who would love crafting these little guys with there facial expressions. It bums me out it didn’t happen. You just hope that in the future when we’re living in an economy that has no scarcity of resources, we’ll get to see that type of art get created in abundance. If anything it makes me look forward to the future as long as that future doesn’t include 4 attacks on mars. I wanted to give it 3, but it deserves a 4. I was negging the effects, but I don’t know man I have to give it a 4.

WR: Mysteries of the Organism,Ben,"So I watched this movie today. I had to write Flarnchain and I got too drunk. So I watched it today with Jean. There were moments I had to put her on the ground because I didn’t know if she should be watching this. She couldn’t understand it, but there were moments when a woman was massaging a mans flaccid penis to make a dildo. Is this art, I don’t know. The penis that comes out of the mold is so much bigger… my understanding is that it was so much larger than the penis that went in it. I feel like there were some interesting things in the movie. Some was heavy handed, but it was the 70s so I’m going to be generous and give it 2 sexy sex footballs.
",2
Monkey Bone,Ben,"I have a confession to make. I watched this movie intermittently throughout this day but mostly toward the end while I had repetitive tasks to do. This movie was insane. I ended up probably like making hundreds of errors during that 90 minutes and it was worth it. I would never take that time back from that time gone. I have to share my position about the structure of the way the worlds interact. It was important to me. The whole thing where B. Fraiser enters the dream world where it’s different than the real world, but it’s different than the blockchain of the real world, like the interchange w=between the real world and the blockchain world is l=different and I think the differences are meaningful even though I can’t articulate the differences. I will give this 4 organs from Chris Kattan’s dead body. I think if I could interchange with myself it may have been different like I could have given it 1, but it was different.

Magic Mike,Ben,"How am I doing? OK, uh, I’ll go. So, you ready? I have seen this 1 time before. It was recommended by Aaron Wittwer. Her has really good taste. He has more knowledge about film than me. Most of my deep cut knowledge came from him. I would use it when I felt knowledgably outgunned by my friends who went to Purdue, IU, or Ball State. I watched this and loved it 10 years ago. I watched it again on Monday and still loved it. I don’t think it deserves a 5 because of some of the flaws discussed earlier. If it was shorter it would get 5, but instead it gets 4 capfuls of GHB.
",4
DRUK (Another Round),Ben,"I really liked this movie a lot the first time I saw it, which was like right after or before I moved. I felt like it had a perfectly subtle blend of that all sorts of emotions you could feel. It never makes you feel them too strongly until certain peaks. It breaks it in certain points which I think is great and when it’s important. Like after Martin smashes his face on the door and is bleeding everywhere. Like I shouldn’t be drunk at work.

The second time I saw it I liked it even better. If a movie gets better the next time you see it, it gets a 5 with a point in front for my BAC.

Lapsis,Ben,"Alright, this movie was recommended by my father-in-law bunches of times, “it going to blow your minds it’s so good.” “Ok, I only get to pick once every 6 movies so chill out.” “Did you pick Lapsis”, like no. I told him 3 days ago that I had picked this and he was so hyped. He was like “I’m going to watch this again tonight” like 3 weeks after he watched it for the first time. Anyways, I liked it, for what everyone said the first act was great, then it just sorta dragged on and peter’d out at then end. I’m going to give it 3 unusually out of place pillow fights.

The Skin I Live In,Ben,"So I watched this with Allison last night and we were both pretty quiet watching it. Watching movies in the basement is pretty great. I hadn’t had a chance to watch something in comfort like that in a long time like since high school. We didn’t talk much. There were moments like the rape scene where we were like wow this is going on way too long, this is too much. Then at the end we were like that’s really good, that was interesting. Sam got it right with the moral ambiguity. Good use of color or whatever. My point is this movie is the good good at moral ambiguity and anything that does the good good deserves 4 nonconsensual vaginoplasties.

Sorcerer,Ben,"So this movie, I didn’t enjoy watching it a whole lot. My expectations on the name or the set up or the narrative I’ve constructed in my head can affect the way I experience the movie. This movie, to me, felt like torture during the middle parts. I liked the first sequence with the truck and the logs was good but then followed up with the truck on the rope bridge followed up with the other truck on the rope bridge. I know it should have felt weighty, but at that point in the film I had already lost interest. The characters didn’t have much dialog and the long scenes are not the style I particularly enjoy. I do think listening to a lot of the conversation about this movie gave me a greater appreciation for the film, but I’m going to go ahead and give it 2 drips of nitroglycerin.
I thought maybe it would be a 1 but talking about it there were parts I liked. Like the watch and the parts at the beginning were good. It was just really boring for me. Just saying it sounds embarrassing to me.

Shogun Assassin,Ben,"So, I watched this movie last night so I was procrastinating, but I watched it lights off, headphones on and gave it my full attention and I’m happy I did that. It was a very enjoyable experience. There were certain points when I would LOL. There were joyous points or points where I would laugh, and it wasn’t funny but I was mirthfully enjoying the experience. I was expecting to be bored. I was like I have a feeling what this is going to be about, but you forget how satisfying it is to have security watching the main character and knowing they are going to be a straight fucking boss. It gets rid of the stress watching some films. I truly truly enjoyed it. I will choose 4 swords for this movie. I would have probably chosen 5 balls without the voiceover, the voiceover threw me off. In retrospect if I could watch this without the voice over, there were some scenes… that would be tight.

Driven,Ben,"I'm going to review this movie. I enjoyed watching in a sense that if I was watching it with you guys the whole time we would be having shit to say. I was like oh my god what the fuck am I watching. The eye rolls. I was thinking of you guys watching this movie. The movie was absolute garbage and to be honest the comical level of male gaze . I couldn't clean myself of the grime that was so 2001. I think it was a great unit of measure to rate this movie out of and sense there was 1 in the movie, I'll rate this 1 denim pant hats. Hat pants. Got it. ",1
Exit Wounds,Ben,"shag: ""the car owner, the fact they make fun of a black person who thinks hes black and tx and dmx like segall wrote that scene""

""I want there to be a black guy who is like not all black guys are black, but sometimes white guys are black""

OK, so I watched this movie with allison. And like it was a trip. Starts off with just crazy machine gun on helicopter in detroit. Full on terrorist attack gunning down cops left and right. Seagal with his goofy ass truck in an ice cream truck. Then its like a buddie cop movie. He saves the VP from terrorists and they are like firing him. I felt like I watched 10 movies and none of them were good. There were a couple grousome deaths that were shocking and 2 funny deaths by impalment at the end. A steal tub cuts through the wall and the steam pipes. ""Why don't you let off some steam?"" This What if this movie had more 1 liners.
I would say it was good to watch while drunk and it was boring in a lot of ways. I have to give it 2 heroin starchy shirts.",2
Pink Flamingoes,Ben,"Go down Flarncoin!!!! I command you!!!!

This movie was disgusting in the truest sense. I think sam said that the something about dude who did horror movies in this style might be a reference to this. I did pick up on the underlying idea that it was supposed to be fun and the manic chaotic type funny humor. Like eric andre, it's similar but like for some reason I wasn't able to enjoy the humerous aspects as I was watching it. I would like to believe, like I almost feel disappointed in myself. If watching a movie, if your reaction to watching a movie is running a race then I almost dropped out of the race on this one. It feels almost embarrassing at this point having listened to the conversation. I've never been so put off of a movie that I thought I couldn't finish it until yesterday. I really didn't like it, I have to give it, I have to read myself in a way, fuck, I have to give it zero puckering dancing airbreathing buttholes.",0
Three The Hard Way,Ben,"I think I made it clear I liked this movie. I tried to listen to what everyone had to say, you guys are really good at breaking info down live, so being able to listen to you guys talk about it is like watching it again. Watching it through a lens that has more depth to it seeing new perspectives that I didn't notice. If I didn't like it I have no problem blabbing on and on about my dipshit. When I enjoyed all ove it. It kind of dragged on at the end. In any normal viewing I would have been busting out laughing, but for this I was just like ok. Maybe I was just oversaturated. Reguardless this convo was amazing. Its interesting hearing both Sam and Shaggy, they have a bunch of shit going on and they aren't looking forward to it but when you make the time for it it just makes it so fucking worth it. Thats how I've felt these past couple weeks. I basically want to give this, not a perfect movie by any means, but.. Allison interupts with June... I'm going to give this movie 4 hotdog tonights, jesus, I don't remember what its called, titty biker gang killer super duper killers.",4
Mallrats,Ben,"I knew about this movie but I'd never scean it. I knew about it, I heard about it when I was younger in grade school and friends were allowed to watch it but I wasn't allowed to watch R rated movies for obvious reasons. Remember when you would talk about a movie and that was your way of telling a joke, like it was something racy. I remember someone telling a storie about a 3 nippled woman who can tell the future and I remember imagining this scene and laughing so much about it. Even hearing a person talk about that part in the movie was breaking ground with me, I was laughing because I didn't know what to do in that situation. Soi that's all I got with my prioors with this. Also I made a short film that I named after this movie,. It was more literal in it's imagery, because it had an actual rat in it. Watching this movie was, I definitely did the thing where the expectiations were so totally insane. The scene at the beginning where the main character tells a woman she would look fat on TV and she swamuntil she died, like it set me up for something crazy. Some of the 90s humor just doesn't land for me, there were parts where I found it interesting but wasn't laughing but other parts where I would laugh out loud. I actually enjoyed watching the movie. I liked the monologue at the end to the cround where Broadie just steals the show. I was made uncomfortable about a 15 year old talking about sex. I can see how that subplot was sex positive, but it made me feel uneasy. Maybe that's ok, but it made me feel uneasy. Some of these characters were in high school and some in college. I guess I didn't really enjoy it that much. I don't owe it anything, but I'm going to be honest. I'm going to go ahead and be honest and give it 2 chocolate ass palms with a pretzel.",2
Ishtar,Ben,"This movie I watched it over the course of a couple days. I thought it was interesting and fun sometimes but it was unsatisfying a lot of the times. I'll try to be breif. I pretty much aggree with what everyone said. Sam's review was the funniest and I think Jordans was the most to the point but at the end of the day you have to give the 2 male performers credit so you have to give them 2 hit recaads.

Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000,Ben,"ok, well I reccommended this movie and I did it because I was like feeling kind of blue about not being able to play Maraton or Oldboy. Movies are hard to watch sometimes. I need to get better about knowing that in advance. I've always wanted to watch battlefield earth because it's famous for being dumb and hilariously bad. It's just so derivative of stuff that had come before it. It's a joke, but only a joke to you. I enjoyed watching this moive. It's terrible. It's one of the most crazily bad movies I've ever seen. It was a crazy fun movie to watch with Alison. I needed that. There have been some movies that haven't been fun to watch. I was watching this movie and laughing my ass off. I was massaging her back and I felt the muscle relax. I truely believe this movie deserves 5 psychlo gynocyders. ",5
Waiting to Exhale,Ben,"So lets see here. Hplly this is funny I always give the longest reviews. First I weant to say thank you for attending the first episode of season 10. This movie was really fun to watch. I really enjoyed watching Whitney Houston and I liked watching Loretta devine go apeshit. I also thought the movie sounded really good. It was putting out nice sounds except the sex scenes. I really just enjoyed watching the entire film. I'm going to give it 4 enduring friendshipts.

Sam:Holly don't be fooled. This is Reif trying not to show his ass to you.",4
Predestination,Ben,"I liked this movie a lot. It was suprising that I hadn't seen it because it seems like something I would have been into. I feel like I saw time crime at the same time. This was PC (Post College). Anyways, I really fucking liked this movie but I think it would have been better if it started with out the exposition and started with the bar scene . like before they get into the cray part of that scene, they play with this really ununual customer and locked in bartender, really cool thikg. Anyway I'm going to give it 4 burnt up faces. 4 flaming hot cheetos. ",4

Brilliantovaya ruka,Ben,"I liked this movie it was enjoyable to watch and it was weird to watch cause there were parts that werte hard to follow super well. I liked the guy was called an economist, it was funny. I was trying to explain this movie and I was like it was so hard to explain the plot because i didn't know who anyone was. Some of the people were criminals anf some were citizents. It was like citizerns and good citizend. It was like a comedy of errors. There were parts wher I laughed and parts where I was confuseedd. Weird cuts and speed ups so I'm just going to give it 3 robes with mother of pearl buttons.",3
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,Ben,"Jordan Shag and I were talking about this but Shag was saying he hadn't seen it. I, too, had not seen the full movie. I'd seen some of it on cartoon network. I felt like it was in many ways disappointing to what I was expecting. But, when the joker showed up I was just laughing my ass off. Stone cold sober laughing. Because of the whole manic lunacy of the joker and Mark Hamill going 100. I was going to give it three but I'm giving it 4... what did we score it... batarangs
",4
Victor/Victoria,Ben,Bossanova is that a music type? There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said. I think the jokers girllfriend was my favorite part and julie andrews was my 2nd favorite part and the boady guard was my 3rd favorit part and the detective getting his finger smashed was my 4yth favorite part. If they would have ended the movie on the bed it would have been good but it gets 3 Normas Small Rages.,3
Drop Dead Gorgeous,Ben,"I enjoyed watching this movie and was bummed I couln't watch it on the TV but I got to wear headphones. You know I lol's at a bunch of the jokes watching it by myself but if I was watching this with someone else, we would have been watching like crazy. I pretty much agree with everyone but my sentiment leans toward Ryan's. So for that I'll give it 3 melted beer can hands.",3
The American Astronaut,Ben,Yea this movie was pretty weird but I enjoed it. Some parts I was bored and confused. I think I would have enjoed this more in a group. Enjoed this convo. I was going to give it a 2 or 3 but by the end of the convo I think this gets 4 cigarettes.,4
Bones,Ben,"Its like this move it needs to jam it down so it comes back up at you. So I think that's a good start to the way I felt about this movie. It was just their for 1 hour and 1 minute. Then when Bones became flesh it started and I enjoed that part. The effects, the spooky wall were good. I agreed with everyone so no point inrecreating the wheel. i thought that snoop was tight as a presence but he wasnt in it that much. I give it 2 spooky maggot showers.. rain maggots... 2 spooky rain maggot houses.
",2
Zombi 2 (Zombie Flesh-Eaters),Ben,"So, yea I feeel like I agree with most of the sentiments here. The scene shark vs. zombie definitely the highlight of the movie for me. Without that scene this would be 1 tis out scuba divers, but with it it gets 2 tits out scuba divers.",2
Tales From the Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood,Ben,"So, I'm drinking Natural Light naturdays right now. I've had like 4 of these so far. It's the perfect night to drink these. I watched this fucking movie and it is basically the equivalent to one of these. Total garbage, but I've had 4 of them and I'm not going to say I've enjoed them but there is a lot of sugar in them and it masks the bad flavor and this movie has a lot of tiddies which masked the attrociiousness of it. I'm going to give this 1 pussy train to pussy town.",1
Possession,Ben,"I'll review the movie I picked. Last time I saw this was 10 years ago with Aaron Whitwer. It was his favorite movie. I took it very seriously and at the end I was shocked. 10 years ago, I hadn't watched movieds anywhere close to this movie. I did my very best to be polite about it but I was honest about it. I didn't really want to talk much about it. I was just like, That movie was really crazy. I remember the conversation being awkward. This 2nd time watching it I really enjoyed it alot. I thought it was interesting and intense, um, and funny at times. Which I think is just, it was funny to talk about the funny parts of the movie. I liked it alot so I'm going to give it 4 trash feathers.",4
Misery,Ben,"Let me review this movie now. I think I didn't watch this with Allison, she loves Cathy Bates, but I didn't know she was in it. I didn't know the dad from Elf was in it. So, overall I thought it was good. It had a beauty and the beast vibe, but like beauty was like the beast and the beast was like the guy, but like the beauty was the beast and the beauty from beauty of the beast was James Cain 4",4
Someone's Watching Me!,Ben,"I thought this movei was pretty boring actually. For a lot of the reasons brought up on the negative sider. Thought it was going to be a mystery, but it was just a guy who lived across the street and went to kilill her and got killed by 1 almost grabbed shard of glass.",1
Phantom of the Paradise,Ben,"ok um, so I watched this on my computer which I enjoed because I could put on my headphones. A lot of times on my computer I get distracted but I closed everything down and only watched it on my big screen. That contributed to my enjoyment of the film and I for a while I would try to write fdown the characters and places and know the name of things. This time I did that. i think it contributed to me enjoying the movie because it helped me make sense of the chaos. If i wasn't paying attention I wouldn't have understood the movie at all. It was a very fast movie and there were songs where I wouldn't have known why they were happening. Because of all that I was able to experience it for what it was which was kind of a crazy wild you know what I got kind of HOly Mountain vibes from it. Like going from place to place and lingering in places with some lunacy you aren't really supposed to make sense of but enjoy it. It was just similar to bringing me back to the roots of movie club so I'm going to give it 4 beef.",4
The Lady From Shanghai,Ben,"ok, this movie was pretty fun to watch. I'd never seen any orson wells movies. I knew his name because Id heard it a bunch and was in citizen kane. I remember vaguly hearing orson wells and thinking that it was george orwwell and thinking george orwell was in cinima because of that. i was called a dumb fuck, that was my only memory of orson wells. which is kind of embarassing to say because he is kind of a pillar in the american cinematic universe. so cool. i thought he didnt do a very good irish accent, but i didn't know if he was actually irish. i didn't want to judge him because maybe that was his real voice. And um, i thought the movie was fun. rita hayworth was amazinly attractive and a great presence on screen in general. if that cliff diving was her that was great. the end was fun and crazy and boonkers. I think i like this movie quite a bit more than average so I have to give it 4 close up swearty grisbys.",4
Naked Lunch,Ben,"I have first I am just shocked at the lukewar.. It seemed like this movie wasn't super popular. Having to do with Cronenberg and the expectations that it's cronenberg and the shrough of william s borroghs. I don't know anything about william so I took this totally at face value. I know who cronenberg is and the Fly and the references in Rick & Morty with the accident on earth where everyone is sexually attracted to morty and there is a love potion and they try to fix it but everyone on earth becomes bugs and so then thats my understanding of like, the first time I saw that i didn't know what cronenberging someone meant. What does it mean to cronenberg something. So I came in with that. I thought it was sick. This movie was super crazy and fun to watch. The giant beetles were gross but kinda cute in there own way. I felt attached to clark nova and when he was killed I was sad. At first I was abhorred when clark nova was eating the other typewriter but then I thought that was kind of cute as well. I wrote down more notes on this movie than I have in ages. The fact he killed his wife and lover in the same way. I thought the ending was kind of obtuse for my puny brain. I have to look past the ending and its just all the things that come together for me to have to give this 5 sips from a mugwump jism.",5
Go,Ben,"So, I have seen this movie but I came to this realization that I saw it in reverse when I saw it this time the last scene where they are debating shooting the guy in the arm, I saw that scene first! I was pretty young maybe 7th grade. You know like, my parents had a big cable package with all the movie channels like starz and cinemax. So aft I was done working on the farm i'd flip through the movie channels. I popped in while they were debating shooting the guy. Interesting little tid bit. i thought this movie was pretty good but not as good as it could be so I'm giving it 3 crusty herbal remedies for ya boy.",3
Riders of Justice,Ben,"my day was pretty interesting. I got called a racist because I had to ask a guy if he had supporting documentation for the precious artifiacts that were stolen from his store. And he was like oh you won't believe that I owned this because you're racist. But I couldn't help. There was a snow storm today. 6 inches in 1 hour. It toook alison 2 hours to get home. I took jean to a bar and had beer and jean had a hotdog. My day was pretty decent.

I thought this movie was pretty good. It was on par in terms of intensity with Druk, but it had more limitations. I felt Druk was slightly more cohesive. From my heart I feel like Druk deservs a 5 and this deserves 4 retarded arms.",4
Broadcast News,Ben,"So, I agreed with a lot of the reviews, I picked up on that maybe Johnson was digging the movie more than most and digging tom more than most. Myabe I was smitten by tom a bit. He wasn't as blatent in his cofidence as the movie was trying to seem. The positive at the end that noone ended up together was good. The dumbest shit ever was the final conflict where this woman loves this man but finds out that he kind of got himself into a more emotional state to get that shot was the domino that shattered evertyhrting. Maybe because her view of him was poiseened because Aaron said he was the devil. i thought that was the dumbest shit ever and I hated it. They didn't gend up together which I think was the right call so instead of getting 1 concentrated screwdrivers it gets 2 concentrated screwdrivers. And budweiser.",2
Matinee,Ben,"um. I thought this movie was um pretty good.

I thought that the female lead character reminded me a bit of stephanie densberger with her distrust of the whole establishment thing.

Mant! Was tight.

Um oh yeah. Um the shopping cart movie was super cool, because the shopping cart was like a little doggy, and there was paint and cake splatter everywhere.

overall john goodman was great and the male lead gene was also great.

ill give this one a 3 shopping cart unlces.",3
Playtime,Ben,"okay um I liked this movie in the second half but didn’t expect to be so bored in the first half.

The movie was actually more visually drab than I expected.

Thus, im going to give it a 3 crown brands as entry passes to recursive clubs.

",3
Something Wild,Ben,"I really liked melanie griffiths character because she kept saying ""c'mon charlie"", but that's not enough to carry a movie, specially one with such a scary guy.

Thus, it gets a 3 virginia lubber t-shirts.",3
Juwanna Mann,Ben,"okay so I enjoyed watching this movie with alison. But I also thoght it was pretty bad and weird. Because there is one flawless cgi titty cup in the movie, it deserves one flawless cgi titty cup.",1
So I Married An Axe Murderer,Ben,"so I watched this movie, thought it was pretty good for parts but also fell asleep at the end.

Mike meyers is a goofball, which is great but also has it's drawbacks.

Cop guy was great and liked to see his genuine laughter talking to scottish dad mike meyers.

everyone said everything that needed to be said. not great, but not terrible movie.

im gonna give this movie 2 womans and 0 woooooooooo mans = 2 units.",2
Pretty Woman,Ben,"
if you couldn’t tell, I liked this movie. I liked how it had all of the 1 two punch things - where she disses the clothes girl, so any ways the hotel manager was awesome and the guy in the elevator. Julia roberts' hair.

I personally believe that this movie deserves 4 steamy horse divits.",4
Roman Holiday,Ben,"hot doggy.

Romance and Cigarettes,Ben,"ummmmmm

well this movie was had a huuuuuge cast.

And um. Thanks to ryan for recommending this movie that felt like, at least to me it was from the late 90s. I was thinking about how the matrix came out in 1999 and then this movie came out 6 years later. how weird!

um. every one said all the stuff that i was mostly thinking, so lets just get this over with:

i didnt like the end but i thought the beginning and middle were pretty cool. but i really didnt like it all that much. gonna give it 2 cucumbers in gardners butt.",2
Secretary,Ben,"
anyways, um dakota johnson pretty awesome but maggie gylenhaal was even more awesome.

I liked maggie and the way she portrayed her character so much that I gotta, against all odds and criticism, I gotta give this movie 4 paddle smacks in the bafroom.",4
The Rocketeer,Ben,"okay without further adoe, lemme review this pooty poo!

I did not really like this movie all that much I thoguth the soundrack made me very sleepy.

The action was good at the beginning okay in th emiddle and bad at the end even though there was more of it at the end.

jennifer connely was very sexy.

alan arkin pretty good.

and there was a giant, which i thought was kinda dumb.

Midnight Run,Ben,"johnson: I did love the barkeep looking at the window and getting swindled. ""hey I think I been swindled""

kevin: charles grodin woulda presented himself as mosley.

Jordan: cause local police came out and like eyyy wadda you talkin bout. That woulda taken a week in 1987.

hake: mosley got fired at the end of the movie.

jordan: hes a grifter man, he's a fake.

hake: he busts serrano at the end.

johnson: pointers about serrano? good to feel like a cop again. FBI was like ""this all goes straight you gotta job.

hake: groden loses deniro to marvin, the the guy behind the diner counter serving him coffee was in repo man.the weirdo with the one line i remember. john wayne guy. always burning trash and talking about time travel in repo man.

sam: i didnt see repo man dawg. i left before everyone watched it. i was not listening til someone heard my name.

Hard-Boiled,Ben,"I thought this movie had a lot violence and strong bullets and strong bodies.

I also thought that the version I watched had interesting font for the subtitles. That was pretty cool.

Most of the cantonese seemed to be dubbed over, I think called adr. it kinda messed with my head a bit, and i dont know where im going with this.

i liked it but too long. 3 day saving little piss pots.",3
Toys,Ben,"okay.

I watched this movie on my phone. Yes the same phone that's now busted. I watched before it was busted.

Laughter.

I thought this movie was trying to be something that it wasn’t and therefore I didn’t really enjoy it all that much.

however, the scene where the general kills all the un truck was my favorite, and so it gets 2 cancelled safe space peas and carrots.",2
The Last Emporer,Ben,"I wrote down this quote and it goes like this:

""you are responsible for what you do""

okay, and that was the thing the prison guard said to henry. And that really showed how important it is to be reeducated.

No but for real, this movie had a huge impact on me the first time i saw and i really enjoyed it and looked past a lot of the weird shit even the second (well this was the third time) i saw it.

4 turds in a bowl.",4
Strange Brew,Ben,"I really think that this movie was a lot of fun to watch.

Rick and um. The other guy, they were both great, except I knew that rick was in movies I had seen before.

So that gave him more points.

Regardless, of all that. We can say for certain that Hake is a great guy, who picked a great and funny one. It really warmed my sould to know the he was driving across america watchin this movie on a fuckin VHS.

Good one hake. This gets 5 two minute pisses on a looney bin from this guy.

The Natural,Ben,"okay Ill review this movie. I think that the subplot with harriet bird and memo pariso could have been fleshed out a bit more and that bummed me aout a bit.

I think that it would have been cooler if roy hobbs only hit homeruns 100% of the time. but otherwise it was was pretty great and i wish i had his haircut.

Little Shop of Horrors,Ben,"so ill review this.

I think I agree with pretty much everyone about most of the stuff we talked about.

Loved the practical effects and puppeteering. Loved the voice acting and thought steve martin was awesome in the way he got eaten by the hero.

the hero of this movie was audry II and it's clones.

the destruction of the human race was it's goal, and it succeeded, and its a damn shame that the actual plot of the movie was not known by most moviegoers of this film.

ima give this one a 4 glitterly lily funeral arrangements.",4
Uncle Buck,Ben,"I watched this movie on my birthday.

I asked alison if I could watch this movie on my birhday and make a cake and um eat indian food, and we had a great time.

Jean watched the first hour. Then she had to go to bed, then we watched the last 40 minutes.

this movie was very serious. I thought it was going to be more goofy.

I also thought it was very goofy. and not as serious as i thought it would be!

such a paradox. paradoxes are pretty tight, and so is this movie, i give uncle buck 4 gnat eating circumcisms.",4
Office Space,Ben,"office space. Rules.

I watched this on comedy central.

I don't konw how i old i was when this came out. This movie is pretty tight. It had an actual impact on my career (not good).

I think its hilarious its really good I like this movie you guys should like this movie too - 4 bobs.",4
The Karate Kid,Ben,"um. I liked it. But I also thought it should have been called the kung-fu kid.

Pretty lame if you ask me.

Jaden was pretty good. I thought the girl was pretty good, so that is where I disagree with everyone.

Too much agression in the competition, didnt make sense to me.

so it gets 3 jackets-off with attitude.",3
Jupiter Ascending (re-view),Ben,"I watched watched this by myself and I actually thought it was more enteratining than I expected it to be!

Um but it still really sucked badly, with the action and acting and script, so ill gvie it 2 space roller blades. Gotta get those differential equations.",2
Dhoom,Ben,"
By ChatGTP
""Dhoom (2004) is a classic Bollywood film that has all the elements of a typical Bollywood movie: drama, action, and song-and-dance. However, for me personally, the movie didn't quite live up to the hype.

The story revolves around a police officer named Jai Dixit and his sidekick Ali Akbar Fateh Khan, who set out to capture a ruthless biker thief named Kabir. The plot was predictable and at times, a little too over-the-top for my taste. The acting was decent, but nothing particularly outstanding.

One of the highlights of the movie for me were the action scenes, particularly the high-speed bike chase. They were well-choreographed and definitely added some excitement to the film. However, the frequent song-and-dance numbers were not really my cup of tea and often felt out of place in the story.

Although I didn't find the movie particularly engaging, I did find myself laughing at some of the more humorous moments in the film. Overall, while I wouldn't say that Dhoom is a must-watch, it is still an entertaining film that fans of Bollywood movies may enjoy.""

I give this movie a 2 sunglasses.",2
Inu-Oh,Ben,"I had to watch this movie on my phone, but actually my phone has a pretty good screen so it wasn't that bad.

I also had headphones on while watching it, which is awesome, cause the soundtrack and sound effects ruled.

I really liked it. I liked how simple the story was. It was clearly a love story between two outcasts that wanted to be incasts.

4 cursed elongated arms. got it.",4
Super Mario Bros.,Ben,"watched this with Jean and Alison. Alison was constantly confused about why the hell it had nothing to do with mario. She kept being like ""wait, that's in mario?!""

Jean really liked Yoshi and just kept saying ""where's the baby dinosaur?!?!?!""

um, if Yoshi would have eaten Lena, woulda been 5 screamin martini worms, but instead it is 4 screamin martini worms i loved this movie.",4

Every Which Way But Loose,Ben,"*cLyde*  
Very early in the movie we meet Clyde. He's an orangutang. After we meet him, he shares a beer with Clint Eastwood. This movie is absolutely insane.

*fights*  
There's lots of fighting in this movie, where Clint Eastwood is either outsized or outnumbered. Clint Eastwood always beats up the people he is fighting and wins without really needing to put in much effort.

*ma*  
Clint Eastwood's character has a crazy mom who has some sort of running gag regarding her ability to drive.

*the black widows*  
Clint Eastwood starts a fight with the local neo nazis, and they are trying to kill him. He also starts a fight with Skyler, the singer lady's boyfriend, who alsow ants to kill him.

*bar fights*  
This movie kind of reminds me of that other movie we watched this season with all the bar fights.There's lots of bar fights in this movie. At least 2 big ones. Alright, less than half way through the movie, the neo nazis, cops, and a shotgun weilding crazy guy are trying to kill clint.

*on the road*  
Now our adventurers have picked up a lady on the way to find the other lady. A monkey, two brothers and a lady named Echo are riding in a truck.

*neo nazis at the diner*  
There is a very weird scene at a diner where the neo nazis walk into a diner and then fight a bunch of the patrons outside. Then after the fight, a cop driving a semi-truck runs over one of the neo nazi's motorcycles. Then... i guess the patrons help the neo natzi's escape? I don't really know. I guess the cops are worse than neo nazi's in this world.

The vibe of this movie is offputting and strange. Vulgar, agressive, violent, filled with unnecessary and unexplaind destruction.

*mas yard*  
There is an awesome scene where the neo nazis drive their motorcycles all around the yard of clint eastwood's mom, and then she pulls out a shotgun and blows up a bunch of their motorcycles. They brought it upon themselves by destroying here porch.

*harmonizing at the bar*  
Later on we see the singer lady out at a new bar signing with a guy. They are harmonizing and I have now idea how they make that sound but it's reaaal nice.

*clint on the town with orangutang*  
Clint Eastwood takes the orangutang out on the town drinking beers, and goes to a couple of strip clubs. It's pretty bizzare. They walk passt the same storefront a couple times. I think they are supposed to be in denver at this point? I don't really know. We are slightly past halfway, and now the movie is starting to get a bit boring.

*orangutang sex*  
When clint get's back from a night on the town with his orangutang, he goes on a sort of tirade and needs to get out of town. He's upset that Clyde the organgutang doesn't have a lady orangutang to like.. make love with.. so he takes clyde to the fucking zoo.

Clyde goes into the orangutang enclosure and finds a female, shuts the door, and there's the implication that Clyde just had sex with the female.

*fight at meatpacking plant*  
There's a common theme about some legendary figher Tank Murdock... apparently Tank is just as good as our hero clint eastwood. Anyways, we arrive at a high intensity feed lot / meat packing plant combo, where orville has arranged clint eastwood to fight some guy who ""stacks up to tank murdock"", because our crew is running low on cash.

The fight ensues, and it starts off like clint is being cautious because the fight might be close, but then clint just completely obliterates this guy. Actually, i take it back. Turns out you can take a lot of shots to the face in this world. And cheat. The guy grabs a meathook and tries to actually kill clint eastwood with the meathook. Then the bookie who set up the fight is like ""we aint gonna pay yous fools"" but then the lady from the national lampoons movies actually pulls out a six shooter revolver and shoots one of the carcasses hanging near the asshole who was trying to con our heros.

*campsite*  
clint goes for a run at the campsite in the mountains. there was also a bowling and a scene with the cops earlier. And a scene where nancy is in daisy dukes and doing some bowling.

clint actually ran into nancy on his run, and mentions that she didn't even get a chance to meet clyde. There is perhaps some funny busines going on with nancy. she doesn't seem at all excited to see clint.

Then they have sex. In a hotel? In the truck? I dunno. She seems to be conning filo.

*fly fishing*  
the cops finally meet up with philo and the gang. he's caught some fish and they are going to kill him with shotguns. seems a bit unnecessary.

Fucking rattlesnake.

The cop is going to apparently blow philo's head off with a shotgun, but sees that Philo caught a very large fish, so instead of doing that, he starts helping philo with instructions on how to reel the fish in... then philo gives the cop the fishing rod and... when the fish is reeled in he smacks the cop in the face with the fish, and then punches out the other cop who was oddly sent around the lake as backup. then he sinks the truck of the cops.

*mountain town*  
we arrive in a mountain town. the nazis have met up with lynn and they discuss the matter of philo betto. lynn confirms that she doesn't really like philo. then philo rolls in and has a showdown with the neo nazis. He, predictably, kicks everyone's asses.

This movie kind of has a ""warriors"" vibe. Like the costumes and the way everyone is kind of archetypal. Orville hijacks a forklift dumptruck and then smashes all of the neo nazi's bikes. This movie is like... way too long.

*Dancing charlie rich lounge*  
more singing at a bar. It will likely result in some sort of big fight sequence. I'm ready for this, but honestly it's been enough. Or maybe just some good music. Mr. Charlie Rich signing some good songs.

Then we see lynn walk outside and kiss the guy she was signing with and she says ""knight me - want me"" and she is caught. The moment of reckoning.

This confrontation culminates in a violent outburst by lynn where she beats on clint and his face becomes bloodied. It is quite the spectacle.

*another fight - tank murdoch*  

Clint eastwood ha fighting shoes. They are actually running shoes. lol. brother at the start of the fight says ""dont worry about it philo, guys a real porker""

All of these fights have people not using any sort of guard. How come nobody uses their hands to protect themselves from getting punched in the face? Such a weird thing.

Clint eastwood, predictaibly beats the crap out of tank murdoch. He's now punched tankin the face like 30 times in a row. That's gotta be a game over. 3 knockdowns. 4 knockdowns.

Even though clint beats the crap out of tank murdoch, he throws the fight and gets punched to the ground. I think he threw the fight because he was feeling all sad about chasing that lady down.

I also don't really understand what the deal was with that guy hustling lynn or whatever. This movie has no point. This movie is i guess a seinfeld episode sort of movie.

final verdict? Not great, really weird, incredibly unsatisfying ending... kind of funny, kind of annoying, crappy fight scenes, good country music, and um... yeah I think this movie was just okay. Also the orangutang part was really weird.",3

Older horror suspensy 70s thrillery stuff I thought this was cool was def thinking of hereditary a lot just in like cerebrally type thing well ahead of its time. Intrigued by that. The audio was insane. talking more about it made me like it more. not knowing what the italians were saying added to confusing and unsettlingness unease. thought religious aspect was going to be more. wanted more unsettling stuff. give me more. more direct horrory type. that one jump cut when she comes out and screams and it cuts to a phone ringing i dont remember there was an audio jump cut super jarring first 30 minutes didnt love thes core or soundtrack so lighthearted wanted it to be more darker wasnt enoguh payoff at the end. going diff directions. simple. maybe good maybe bad. totally worthwhile if you horror fan. 3 licks of d sutherlands toopaaaazed mustache

Blanked out about sound guy this movie is fucking ridiculous. I just uh. looked past the dumb shit in this movie. serial killer lithgow chase i was like okay this is what this movie is now. then it flipped script at end, he doesnt save her, she dies, hes listening to her being murdered, chillin in the snow. it was just so dark. i dont think it earned all of that payoff but it was going in this hilaroius type of way once it went for gut punch iw as like oh fuck okay. credits. props. wassup. i donno. i.... 3, 4. gonna say 3 screams (thassa good scream) goddamnit i wanted to do a 4

I brought this movie to you guys because I liked it.
I didn’t take a risk, nope. I'm gonna do something I have seen and I like. I think this movie, and maybe i like it more after this conversation, talking abou the sense of like... its swinging for something. its being earnest. but also falling on its face and its straight up bad at times.
its schlocky and the actors are like. like reggie is arguably bad at acting. thats a nice way of saying it. but you're rootin for him for whatever intangible reasons, you want him to succeed. bros. muckin up. of course tehres tune out moments. this is a great movie to throw on at a party. you get to see a quad shotgun.

Gone in 60 Seconds,Jordan,"much like hake there for sure. This was just engrained in my childhood… 12 or 13 when this came out. That summer or whatever when it came out on vhs… probably watched it a dozen or more times. The mummy… those movies are always engrained in my brain. When atley goes to meet roman caletrie with his hand i dont know what that means. its really hard for me to look at it. some of that racial stuff is a problem. this is clearly written by a white man and white people were not consulting with black people. the script the plot a couple dozen times i will see this another dozen times before i die. this is just one of those movies i will not have a problem seeing it. i love the music. the soudntrack. its great. i dunno i, not gonna go 5 im gonna go 4 lazer cut poopy dog keys that i get myyyyyyy jollys off with. coulda gone 5 but well see.",4

I thought everyone in this movie was way tooo old. Average age was 56 years. They were coasting. Uh. Yeah its uh. yeah its a fun movie if you had like 8 hours and this was 2 hours and your kinda not paying attention but you kind of are. this could throw on the backround for the fun characters the win kid look that that stoopidassfuckinpinktie.

The Bad News Bears,Jordan,"
Uh. Yeah.

I really really enjoyed this movie. I've loved this movie for eyars.

We talked about many of the reasons why. It really solidified why. Its the first kids sports movie to like do some of these things as far as the beats and while. It was the template for many kids movies that came not now but in the 80s was clearly biding on this sytle of movie as far as i am saying for the purposes of this speech. it completely subverts those.

its like no. im not gonna do the things they said they gonna do. no win. no super deep character growth or whatever.

this movie did something special.

the kid acting blew my fuckin mind.

the trailer for the newer version. its like watchin a fuckin like uh Adam Sandler movie. with a comedy gag where the kid get hit in th ehead. hit in the nuts. forever. waowhowowhwo. i dunno

it just really worked for me i liked the commentary of th eparents being a precurser to eau parents you see it on the yankees parents faces at the end of the game they could hav edone a lot more with this which is why i dont think it perfectly works they sell that they dont wanna just be kids too hes so pissed at his dad.

i think this movie did a lot of great shit i think i did a lot of shit th efirst time tweak fleshed a few things out wmakie it more rounded film i love this movie it gets a 4 cruds for me

The Neon Demon,Jordan,"I ended last season so ill start this one. Start this trifecta of cannibals off.

I did not like this movie very much. Um.
There was just like so many moments where I thought there was something cool happening. I wasn’t in the right headspace for a styel over substance movie. some of the long scenes were just boring me.

when i thought the plot was moving along i immediately had to look at a picture of elle fanning staring at a mirror for 5 minutes.

ill never watch this movie again.

after the conversation i realized it wasnt a complete waste of time. cosmo panthos mandy fuckin movie style stuff i think samson said something about him being the height of pretention hes making it so ambiguous he wants you to walk away with watever you want you cant ambiguous if youw ant to make it in th emovie you guys know about this shit more than i do. 2 trifectas of cannibilizm.",2
Crocodile Dundee,Jordan,"similar boat I was pleasantly surprised about this movie I thought iwas getting something hammy and cheesy I like this era of comedy remind me of major leauge like americana like dim dnew doon. It was very nostalgiance I love 80s thye look like this racyness like uh like what r might be now but pg13inthe 80s theres problematic stuff but did not like theres no pint where i was like oh my good ooohhh goooodd

hes just so charismatic

when you let paul hogan be an australian guy it works but when doing written dialogue like um.

the girl was a smokeshow she was really working for me

the bathing suite hiking outfit gave me a boner

Beavis and Butt-Head Do America,Jordan,"um.

I didn’t really enjoy this movie very much as well. Uh like sam said this was just not this was nott he show I was watching as a kidt hat ws subversive animation type of stuff.

Like I brought up earlier, this was gen x's answer as far as this typ eof humor to this society it lives in.

our brains are more broken we went through more shit when we were kids 9/11 wars, this humor is just fucking boring. lame. need something more absurd, bonkers, thats my satire i enjoy at this time in my life.

i cant say how well this was received by kids in the 90s by kids our age or whatever.

A Prairie Home Companion,Jordan,"I would have looked at it differently if I was more familiar with the ip.

I was charmed by garrisson keeler doing his dry humor when they all getting ready all talkin past each other not getting the details of thes storyes. I was Hyped.

th emor eit got on it got messier and i just kind of lost the thread a little bit. i get that its like a hang movie. for me it personally just didnt catch me just because i wasnt familiar with it um.

i just thoguht it was long or kind of boring at times. i was still very charmed by a lot of it i thought it was funny i liked all the actors in it.

i just didnt think it worked at times where it wanted to. i just couldnt quite do what i wanted it to.

i think theres just.... like.. i get why these movies are looked upon and better movies came after it that were influenced by these things. lets just get to those movies. i dont want to write off all westerns because thats rude

this movie was just very messy. i didnt really get it it. 4 coffins filled with machine guns but now filled with gold.

Okay. Um. Watched this last night right after finishing the second hyperion book which is in some ways a similar thing. im glad i stopped and watched the bulk of it today.

i liked the experience but id idnt enjoy much of it other than the visuals

i didnt know the arc of this movie. wsa there any character growth for anyone?

the characters that are still around end up exactly like they are.

other than kenichi just wants to dance with robots.

they jsut destroyed a city and are in the exact same state.

sam: makes joe about 5 uncles.

Ieeee. Thought this movie was great with the comedy stuff.

I was really taken into a great spot with the comedy especially with the bombachs self refrential and self deprecating stuf.
Breaking 4th wall comedy like yeah dude i get it im a fuckin hipster makin this fuckin hipster movie im an asshole i get it.

like hes makin a movie about a bunch of fuckin white affluent people i dont give a shit about

Yeah I uh. Also forgot tim burton directed this movie so I think I kinda had him looming over my viewing of this the frist time. I havent seen this since I was a kid.
I don’t know what about this particular viewing...

i get it is supposed to be stupid, i just thought it was so fucking stupid.

maybe if it was a little more honed in it could have been a better more tightly packaged product. it was just kinda all over the fuckin place.

WR: Mysteries of the Organism,Jordan,"I don’t even know where to start with this. Cause i. I agree that you know this is an art house what is the point to try and analyze this.

For the first 30 minutes of this moive I put my pen down im going to try and let this wash over me right?

once it got into the narrative... the tagline of th emovie is like... it starts halfway through the movie. theres the iceskater this person gonna be with with

im gonna try and start writing some shit downs o i can be productive like a good commy

it iddnt work for me in a lotta ways it was exploitative and a propoganda film in its own way maybe trying to combat prop

theres a man making this movie and yes he is writing for females but he is writing them.

Watching it was just like am I thinking of idle hands or some other movie I didn’t understand why he was in this movie.

When it happened It was mangical

i went in with low exp
but then henry sellick and  attention to detail i was really enjoying

the humor aside the 90s mtv style edgy bonerjoke shit was obviously bad but henry sellik doing it all the stuff outside the real world was so amazing and slwo flord it and brendan frazier never act like monkeybone again

Magic Mike,Jordan,"I was very excited to watch this movie. Walways ben on my list. We misunderstood that the two movies were drastically distant.

The joy we were assuming we were gonna get from the gounrdswell was closer in line with the second movie.

however, i think there was some fun shit in here but overall not cohesive.

the turn at maybe it was jus tbecause this is when i paused it and watched the last 40 minutes today.

the turn shifted to crime, drug, drama, thing. i wa slike 

""im not enjoyint this nearly as much asi was tonight""

channing tatum was very charasmatic and fun but it would have been great to know the ogher guys. fluffy was not tight not good drug connect dj guy

but i want this movie to be like the first fast and the furious for the fast and furuoius franchise. we got the characters but the format of the movie or like the way they did this partcular movie is not really waht the cinematic universe becomes in the future.

lets turn these erotic dancers into crime fighters and have like 10 of these and channing is jordnaa brewster and letty is like in and out but we NO we wanted blah we wanted fun friends in this world not like... man i gotta find the right way in who im gonna BE.

DRUK (Another Round),Jordan,"I thought this movie was, so like I didn’t even know what this movie really really was. Amd the taglines like ""comedy"" then watching im getting more serious vibe, but maybe just movie club critical lense syndrome.

I felt like there was a little too much to be in both ends of the spectrum. too serious so beautifully acted and overtones of the relationship drama its a serious movie. 

BUT

its also theres the fun parts and comedyish and i think it would have been more enjoyable or like cohesive for me if it decidedd but not more dark or serious too much mirror type situioaton.

im conflicted i think this movie is a cool really cool concetp i dont know if it necessiarly sells all of it on great package so great watycing wasper ing sni  dance at  the end is fucking great 3 with a point in front ubba myne blood alcohol content.",3
Lapsis,Jordan,"ill try to be quick, talk about a lot of shit.

A babababab. I did a little pros and cons thing. Stick to the pros cause already didt the cons.

Pros: little robots. Teamup with college really cool. Low budget and kinda scary. They werent ever gonna be that scary and low budget not gonna jump.

noise that the cable made while unspooling. like a wratchet.

dean imperiooliman as an actor thought he was fantastic.

cool that it did dip its toes and shit.

the expo they go to with all the subeconomies built off these types of things. really real and really gotta get your gear, you can cable and get your cable on your kayak. that felt cool.

im always down for an original-ish futureistic type of context shoestrignt budget. tons wrong with this movie, tons of exposition, the script was rough at some time. this director gonna get somethin big and then they get a chance to do something crazy.

hopefully he wont write it. but i still rather enjoyed this movie im gonna give it 4 exceptionally inconsequenc-out of place pillowfights",4
The Skin I Live In,Jordan,"I don’t know.

I said pretty much a lot of shit that I wanted to say.

Anything I say now is just purely subjective.

This movie put me a shitty mood, this first half I was like ""what the fuck are we doing here guys, just gonna watch a buncha rape scenes that challenge us?""

so i was just reeling like. thats not a tradition condemnation at all, i am gonna stay. but...

fuck i really did not enjoy it. the plot just needing to be moved on by perpetual violence against women or a created woman was just lazy. looked good, fuck this movie, 1 nonconsentualvagianaplasty",1

Theres something about this movie i really enjoyed it. not i really enjoyed it but i definitely enjoyed.

the score, the fuckin tangerine dream score. do do do do dboodo lets use all the synths. lets do it.

i think we nitpicked a lot of this movie which is valid. a lot of this movie does not operate and i dunno it doesnt make sense, i dont really care. no exposition, zero conversations about anything you just gotta fuckin figure it out that dude at the beginning. one second in veracruz you gotta remember that guys mustache.

i was like whos this guy and why is he in town? whatever.

i think i love this movie becauase you just cant make this movie again. remind me of jodorowsky. almost apocolpse now.

the sound effects were so crazy awesome like i said. the use of silence was really great and not taking me out ofit like some of these dubbed over voiced over audio added later movies do.

it was working on me. i didnt like the narration. the kid thing. these guys try and bring it to an american audience see soemthing great can make money in the western world but just dont, dont dont make athree year old sound like this fees fifteen thank you sam for awaking the showgun assassin wolf n cub world i choose 4 swords.",4

This has been a great conversation and this movie lends itself perfectly to one of thse convos.

its not a good movie.

its a master class in how to not do quality filmmaking.

but... its got that fuckin. thing. that I like! i was raised on this type of movie.

like. where was this movie.

its got that gone in 60 seconds. fast n furious. hammy and bad and bravado and earnestness and swinging for it but hitting ZERO pitches gettin lobbed at it it.

debating whether its art, good, bad... dont think theres a place where i can really weigh on. dont know if john waters was intending for it to be debated that way.

i dont think he intended for it to be rated.

i think history will probably regard this as either a zero star movie or a 5 star movie. but im gonna be a coward and give it 3 dancing buttholes.

free cast, blah blah blah. get more robot camels. smoke some camels. sing some songs. each of these guys get a hit record.

2 rogers n clarke hit recahds.

on a piece.",2
Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000,Jordan,"I'll go.

Um. My rating system, a zero requires me to hate that I even.. Watched it. So.

With that being the basement, this movie, at least, I do not regret having seen this movie.

It is garbage, it sucks.

Travolta is awesome.

Im glad this movie exists, this is a one ker, one cyclo, one kerl,

Kevin: you mean terl?

Jordan: ker? I went with the black guy.

Kevin: tight, he wins in the end

Sam: "" they made me the head cyclo, cause im gonna win for eternity""

Sam: She was like, swarthy, like italian.",1
Waiting to Exhale,Jordan,"harpers bout to clock in brah.

I don’t really have a whole lot to say or anything too well thought out at least… yeah coming into this movie.. This was not a movie im going out of my way to watch.. Ive see a clip or two with holly

I don’t really watch i would consider this liek a chick flick. but really its a totally serviceable movie.

i enjoyed a lot of it, i thought it was really long. this conversation really helped me think of this really nicely. the way they discussed how they show you the spectrum of bad to good and all inbetween.

i was like, oh really there's slow growth happening for all these characters, yeah.

the complicated stuff with wesley snipes, complicated stuff with gloria allowing herself to be her own person. its not high end stuff you would see in rom coms or whatever, you know the grey stuff inbetween.

whoever created sex in the city, like thats that but with white people.

3 enduring friendships :) thank you holly, thank you holly, thank you holly

Im gonna get under the covers with my clothes on and take my underwear off and be like ""uh you gonna start or whatever?""

Sam: Say my name

Hake: Call me big pappa

Johnson: pappas comin

Jordan: oooOOOoooOOO",3
Predestination,Jordan,"try to be breif.

Um

I think at the core of this movie there is something very interesting. The paradox of the ouroborous.

Adapting this story was a cool idea for a simple but small budget sci-fi movie. Even though I didn’t really like the staging of it with the opening conversation at the bar.

going down this path of this brain puzzle, the paradox, is cool and worthwile.

its something that is tough to do in film format.

i dont know what it woulda taken to be sold a little bit better, guessing the right thing each time, and then the fizzle bomber stuff was like "" i dunno i dont really care about this""

i wasnt trying to get my red yarn to fill all the holes.

so totally worth watching movie didnt really blow me away, at the core it is an interesting story to tell.

gonna give it 3 fire flamy faces, fire faces, flaming faces

Mamma Mia,Jordan,"Like Shag said, I was dreading watching this. Not like I was gonna be pissed, but there have been some movies I had 0 interest in watching. Once it started It was delightfully stupid and I wrote down I don't know as much ABBA as I thought I did. I was delighted by some of the stuff, the ABBA songs. There was a song that reminded me of a song in Climax, there was a song like da da da da da da dance shit. It sounded like ""oh to be alive!"" There was a song that sounded like that. But, like, I dont know all that being said, musicals, I'm more like Rachael than anybody. Some are fun if the choreography, but it was not a disappointing watch. I probably missed some of the nuance, but yea 2 TBDs.

Brilliantovaya ruka,Jordan,"*overdoses on heroine*

okay here's my hotshot review. The diamond arm.

I thought it was uh, diamond hands the whole time. Reif will think that’s funny

the diamond arm was a movie that I watched, and it went into my eyeballs, and mostly through my eyeballs, because i didnt hear th elanguage in its native way, because i dont speak it.

what i do speak, somewhat, is comedy. I have a subjective taste of comedy.

this brand of comedy is not necessarily to my subjective taste. with some of the slapstick stuff, maybe cause i missed some of them or naked gun satirical stuff, or any satire, um. is gonna require satire.

maybe i thought this was satire, but this maybe is more ""funny movins"".

and so for that.. it just wasnt really hittin me.

i thought it got kinda redundant. like, so now they are gonna do this thing:

bash him on the head

get him drunk at dinner

beat him up in a bush

there was just some stuff it didnt get there for me. that said, its a cool peak behind the curtain of soviet russia. this is that type of movie that they would put out.

not necessarily propoganda, but more like a big banger comedy. it does have value to me, so i give it 1 robe with pearl buttons.",1
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,Jordan,"Jujitsu is no joke! Batman is a cool character that I like and think is fucking tight. And this is a good iteration of him, its a origin story you haven't seen a million times. A different love interest that you could see them melding weell otgether. Usually they are toxix of a super villian or whatever. The animation is so different and awesome and iconic. Yea. I don't know. It's not my favorit batman sotry ever but watching it I was like this is different and its definitely refreshing. I'm looking forward to Ryan saying this was the greatest batman to be a feature length movie. I give this 4 batarangs.

Victor/Victoria,Jordan,"we will do 2 and 2, not to put the cart before the horse.

Sam: car before horse?

Jordan: har?

Kevin: carhart on the horse.

Jordan: horse is cold, needs protection.

First I would like to say that I took a bathroom break during johnson's review and i pisssed for 19 seconds, so thats cool

shaggy: i pissed for 25 seconds

jordan: i go often.

not trying to die of urinary tract infection.

sam: i should have taken a picture of my alien belly.

i gotta do it again just to show?

jordan:

okay.. i also am a little inbetween on this movie. i dont love musicals already which stacks it against this movie personally.

i think this movie has a lot to do, thank you for bringing this, its cool and representation even if it is 82. its a cool reason to get representation of queer culture out there.

was it handled perrfectly no i dont think so.

club and a bunch of drag queens in the crowd and everyones having a good time... for that im like, thank you.

i didnt like garner. i didnt like the king marshawn, even though thats the point hes sposed to be bigot and comes aroudn in the end.

not saying this movie is supposed to be as progressive as now.

even when then said the f bomb twice i was like it could have been better.

thanks for movie i give it 3 normas small rages.",3
Drop Dead Gorgeous,Jordan,"I don’t have a whole lot to say, I liked this movie. There's so much dated ass shit in here. I wasn’t really busy with trying to figure out how to let it work in my brain, I just let the stupidity wash over me.

Clearly problems.

Comedy is one of those things where you make swings and it might only work at the time and place, but definitly not working 22 years from then.

yeah its problematic but im gonna try to enjoy this movie.

mile a minute, joke every 20 seconds, gives christopher guess a run for his money with unheralded comedic performances and understated comedy with little effort.

The American Astronaut,Jordan,"don’t have anythingt o super coounter that but I will go.

The american astronaut, like I said jeremiah showed me some of this shit and I wa slike, thas weird ill prolly never watch that movie.

Now I have watched that movie. Um. I dunno.

Like we said earlier, this isnt one of those movies where you gotta like.. really try to concisely figure out. its clearly a guy just being self indulgent doing his own thing not asking the audience a lot giving too much fo a shit i kinda just was having a decent time with it i took a break and watch the rest today.

somethin refreshing bout this movie forsure.

scenes will always be weird enoguh like timneric, not as you are laughing happening laugh your assoff so stayign power to this movie, so i dont call this a hot take butim gonna give this 4 cigarettes. was gonna give it 3, but i got spicey.",4
Bones,Jordan,"this is hakes bad. And that is now forever. Hake bad uh hearing one of this good friends.

This is a bad movie. This is a great movie. This was. Im so glad we all were like ""ooh don’t know what the fuck that movie is gonna be"" and then when I finally got to it was like: ""aw man, this is not as fun as i was hopin""

This is 2001 horror movie for sure. i have a lot of respect for the period piece for this type of moive, an intense undertaking. shots, wardrobes and all that.

you guys said everything i wann say, i thought it was pretty rough and good fun shit. worst blood ever. 2 spooky maggot rain-houses",2
Zombi 2 (Zombie Flesh-Eaters),Jordan,"good music and foley, bad acting, good blood, bad adr, good gore, violent gore, bad make-up and prosthetics (I don’t undersatnd but it does make sense).

Im with you guys on pretty much all of that. I also love that I watched most of this movie assuming that the dr was the reason for the zombie outbreak.

the fact that this movie confused me... i gotta give it props.

once i got the full awe shit this movie is a piece of shit i just started having fun, no fire 5 molotovs i was laughing my fucking ass off.

as poorly as i paid attention for the first minutes this movie was just 91 minutes 3 topless scubadivers from ya boy comin right in.",3
Tales From the Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood,Jordan,"for being a theatrical release, this had such tv movie quality to it. And I think a lot of us just assumed that it was a tv movie cause it was on tv so much. Yeah this movie sucked, this movie was bad. I don’t have a whole lot to say.

""Jonas! Jonas!""

""Honey, Jonas doesn't work here, anymore... I retired him!""

Possession,Jordan,"before I start, I want to say this was the last page on this booklet.

Goes back to ""The Little Prince"" from august 5th of 2020.

This movie. Combing back from greenbay today. I was excited about hour 1 but hour 5 was gonna be a chore.

I threw it on, and immediately was like, this is a chore.

But i was not MAD to be watching it, i was just ""this is fuckin not at all going in a direction i want it to be doing""

I wasn't invested in the dialogue or what was going on which was good cause noone knows what was going on.

i did not like to know that she tried to commit suicide after that, like for what? this movie was not that tight so why?

i didn't really love it, but talking to you guys made it like a fun experience. theres some art house movies that I do for these movies but i do for this video night movie club was like a chore, i was like happy to do it but it was a chore.

so yeah, i dunno. that being said. i think im gonna fill i want to be hot and juicey give it a 1 but gonna give it a 2 trash feathers.",2
Misery,Jordan,"I really enjoyed this movie, which im sure noone else is gonna say during this review processs.

It went really quick and I was like: be 90 minutes, be 90 minutes, be 90 minutes. Gimme somethin nice n tight.

But it just went down. It was over. very easy to do. so yeah. i really liked it.

had i not known that this was just such an iconic movie that i just never got around to seeing i just had to imagine if this was new to me it would have been fuckin mindblowing.

tight script, ahead of all the tricks, tight little package, super natural thing and kind of even stuff we pitched in this call. shes so fuckin crazy and wants his books and shes gonna fuckin make him hers.

blood gets a 2 from me cause of that coulda been a 5 but its gonna get 4 bitchly cow corns.",4
Someone's Watching Me!,Jordan,"im gonna be really long and bruuuuuutal.

Dude so like 11 weeks ago to this week, I demanded we do a halloween season. We aint done.

Maybe we finish it next week I dunno maybe we talk after this review.

Just thef act that it was something ive never ehard about theres an amount of gratefulness. plenty to be annoyed by.

theres defintely carpenter in there, i was kinda bored at times.

weve all saide verything. im gonnag vie this its fairly benigned im gonna give it 3 almost grabbed shards of glass.",3
Phantom of the Paradise,Jordan,"point counterpoint.

I don’t really wann talk that much.

I get this movie is being satiracle and a commentary on the state of the union at the time of the 70s musically. So much of this shit was fuzzy and half assed and not fully fleshed out… like hake said earlier one of his earlier films, not tryin to judge too much

not worth judging too much its like here's this fuckin thing we did.

but in the end, it really just felt like an inside joke that i was not a part of, so i just couldnt really get all around it, i dunno.

this conversation was definitely a lot better than... um... where my head was after watching and living with it for a day.

it was not for me. fuckin no. i dont like musicals, i dont like rock operas, whatever.

anyway i cede my time this is getting 2 beef.",2
The Lady From Shanghai,Jordan,"the lady from shanghai.

I enjoyed watching this movie suprisingly. Im the guy that is very outspoken about not enjoying older movies or just spending the time watching older movies.

But they are getting easier to.. They are just movies. Onceyou get to know them and interact with them, they are just like you. they are just moobies. not scary. just black and white.

so this movie was totally fine and super confusing. like for a movie with lots of voiceover and exposition, to not really follow super well was kinda funny to me.

the courtroom scene blew my fckin mind. courthouse scene gotta be watched on loop. truly ridiculous. everyone has 3 sweaty excitable grisbizbizzies.",3
Naked Lunch,Jordan,"I forgot mosta this movie already.

I was really excited to see another cronenburg movie cause he's an interesting director…. I guess.

Hes iconic as fuck, but this movie was very bad.

There were parst where I was was like holy shit cronenburg but then i got bored in the last half.

BUT there was a couple two parts in there as well.

im here for croneburg. bugs are very funny to me.

and these were some bugs. and aliens.

3 sips of mugwump jhism.

this movie was bugs.",3
Go,Jordan,"
same path. Tipped my gronola crunchy herbal rave shit

uh.

Yeah it just was like. They were like, ""you know how they make good movies? Lets do that! Except not""

so I dunno, I knew it was gonna be a fun conversation, which it has been, cause this movie is just crazy.

but its just meandering and it doesnt know what its doing.

the idea of these 3 storylines coalesct and create but these kids are like fuck it we survive everything as gen x fuck you doesnt matter, maybe theres something cool

the gay stuff is cool maybe for being 1999 for a studio movie.

overall i was like blah, blahhhh

so half of what shag gave it 2 crunchy herbal rave shits. i dont think thats a good movie.",2
Riders of Justice,Jordan,"fuck okay.

Here we go.

Fuck okay.

So.

I had to work at 8 oclock this morning, I worked til noon at one clinic. I came home.

I had to finsih watching the last fifty minutes of this movie.

Then I went to school. Because my other school hada game tonite but didnt wanna movie it up but only 1 game even though freezy rain at 730 so practice ended at 130 and i came home at regular amount of time with holly

then we fell asleep reading words of radiance.

then i went to work. then i came home. then im here.

i got to leave and come home 3 times a day wich was nice.

that was my day and its a new thing we do.

i really liked this movie. this movie coulda been fucking amazing but instead it was less

i really like what ryan said about friends. regular action comedy like dopy friends but back story what you are led to believe series fucking shit i didnt get into but up a lvel for me coulda been great is not a homrun but fuckin interesting ass 4 chubby salamis.4",4
Broadcast News,Jordan,"this conversation was fun. I was late, stressin to get here. Took so long and fuckin annoyed cause it was a game I wasn’t told about, coach was a complete piece of shit.

Got into a fight with my athletic director, so I stuck around to help with him, and it took forever to get here. i wanna get on this fuckin call and talk about this bland ass movie.

this movie is not my favorite, i dont think i wanna watch this movie ever again.

if i wanted to watch a movie about broadcast news i would watch something else, like the third season of the wire or like fuckin boston globe or whatever. news favorite one. journalism nightcrwaler truth warriors.

this is just barely dipping its toe in and i was just kinda bored.

i had fun talkin bout it, at the core, awe jeeze this is a movie about golly jee swell folks and sometimes they heckin cuss.

Matinee,Jordan,"I don’t hav e a whole cohesive thing point to make but when I paused this movie tonight at like an hour in, I found a documentary about nikolodeon, which was fine, but it reminded me of my childhood.

Going through watching these shows, so much bad acting, i dunno. goin gfrom the movie to watching that was very weird.

also the beginning of the movie and his brother is hiding reminds me of doug and this movie comes through town and h  e was afraid to look at it and he takes all episode to work up the courage and sees the zipper on the back of the zipper and is like its a fuckin zipper costume! keeping his eyes closed. no point to make this movie was fine.

Dude, last night I was 2 city living in a 2 gay paris.

I was in a shitty down mood so this movie was not hittin it for me. Mr magoo mr bean is not funny to me.

If im being honest to you I did not smile once while watching this movie.

you have to learn the language of this guys comedy before you can really appreciate it.

first understanding tim and eric its furnny the more you think about it then just in the moment experiencing it.

in the moment not enjoy but better time remembering the movie.

could watch again in a few years like oh this shits crazy.

ill agree about revering it for it's mastery, gotta go with experiencing it last night, but now im a 3 crown brands as entry passes to recursive clubs.",3
Something Wild,Jordan,"cosmo was passed out the whole night like a lil asshole.

Get the fuck off this table bro.

Didn’t hate this movie. I thought it at least like flew by, for a near 2 hour movie, which I think for a rom-com / rom-com esque movie should be pretty commendable.

we will get into it i guess, we gonna do like 2 of them. melanie griffin annoying with aesthetic which we got into.

took it down for me regardless of our ability to put that into a problematic box of movies made from a long time ago.

i didnt find enough full on problems with it ray liotas blah blah blah 3 virginias for lovers t-shirts.

Juwanna Mann,Jordan,"
I echo everything everyone said. Ryan said lazy, I felt that. There was an attempt at a movie here. It wasa  bad attempt. I feel bad cause I was hoping it would be worth a good inspired conversation.

Didn’t really do that kinda a stinker all around so that kinda sucks.

but whatever. i wasnted to havea shit season so goodlocuk to the resta youguys.

not tryinta woesime but i didnt get so much mysoginsitic and old jukes that were outta time and whole movie but on toppa that kinda find so you kinda just eugh all the time nothin earned and end up together at thend is so fuckin lazy and fuckin bullshit and bad writing.

I was like, awe man there wasnt a world where they werent gonna end up together, which is fine, its gary marshall. He's paint by numbers, but good enough at it where you are like okay yeah it coulda been funny where's the com, too much rom.

Roman Holiday,Jordan,"I agree with lotta shit.

This movie too long.

Too long.

Girl is asleep for first hour.

Which is funny but then it goes on and on and on and on (sounds like tucker carlson cause of truth thing)

she does sleepy bit for too long. 

Aubrey Hepburn is one note.

This movie could have been in color. That would have been good.

That would be a good touch: see rome in color?

Gelatto.

Let's go.

Gimme that spice.

The last true thing I think: I dont' know a whole lot about old movies.

What genre of move is this?

It comes from an era of ""there's only a handful of movies""

This is the genre of movie. It tries to have serious Gregory Peck crying and slapstick and action, and it's not all at the same time.

Which is weird interesting quirck of movies like this, like it's the only thing made.

Maybe it makes me get closer to old movies, but also not enough nuance for my fine tastes.

Other movies perfected later, in different decades.

Good convo. Super bored during the movie.

So I didn’t have to deal with johnson's bullshit, I could talk. I appreciate that.

Could not decide if i fuckin loved it or fuckin hated it. i brought up fuckin uh, eh, masked and anonymous earlier. i dont even remember masked and anonymous... i dont know what tutorru was doin tellin people do go for it and it doesnt work... and it doesnt work cause it works. and oh this is a bad movie i just wish people saw cause its fuckin crazy.

gonna pretend last 30 minutes dont exist cause its fuckin shitty but furst hour 15 mins fuckin tight i dont like musicals where theres just 2 lines of dialogue, but those were bonkers part and greatest part.

clif seacord and this movie just fuckin awesome.

its like bad and when its goodbad. like kinda that vein i dont know how he did that kinda shit.

one annoying thing, in the fucking plot somewhere, it says ""nazi"" like dude, i dont remember that. the nazi reveal would be the most insane thing in the third act of this movie.

it is, but i read that it was nazi, so i knew that it was nazi all the time. that woulda blown my 5 year old mind it made sense the rara fuckin bullshit movie.

stakes remain stakes and win nationals and get abck to winning nationals, and all jennifer connely cares about winning nationals and this movie did not fuckin disappoint me at all 4 gum wrappers of pepsin gums chewing gum. what the fuck was it?

its super sloppy i wsih i coulda seen it first time for this movie knowing a few things david h pierce is bad hes doooin a thing thats pretty much all i memebred.

Midnight Run,Jordan,"I liked this movie as well. This was good movie.

I almost picked it for my M season when we all did Ms. I ended up going with I don’t remember, but glad we got around to this.

Cause this movie is a template for good writing, good fuckin really well made movie.

there was aspects coming from a time now from now like they could like polish off like a coupla sharp ends in this movie but it's very effective for what it is and not asking too much of anyone, not asking too much of the audience its just heres a good thing enjoy.

a lot of cussing so fucking glad there just good not nuance cussing. just im gonna rip your fuckin head off ey im gonna rip your fuckin head off ey dont be quiet over here im gonna rip your head of.

johnson said did goldmember rip off that helicopter scene, having not seen this movie til now was this the first ever two hander that's effective, walter hill martin breast shine on this movie was delicious.

coulda been shorter (better for critic efficiency, duh) so yeah good shit.

4 non-counterfiet counterfiet coins.",4
Hard-Boiled,Jordan,"yeah. Kinda stumbled into this movie actually. I know there's jon woo and other crazy darker gnarlier movies, I don’t even remember why I picked this one, maybe I saw it on action boys or something.

i dont have much to say.",4

I don’t have a ton more to add, I think we just nailed it like ""who is this for?"" ""what is this movie trying to say""

I gotta say I woulda never thought about this movie critically. Everyone knows about toys its toys 1992 weird movie I watched as a kid but never really dug.

doing this now im like, i donno man. i dont think i really jived with whatever the fuck this movie was trying to do.

at the time like this movie ridiculous and kinda fun, but really it's not fun. johnson hammered it was robin williams not doin great in this movie.

ryan said what hes doing and what hes trying to be in this movie im like yeah meh, its visually really stimulating and crazy and can be serios but its really not for kids. yeah i dunno.

im gonna give it uh. 1 pea and 1 carrot, so combined its gonna get 2 peas and carrots in a problematic puke pile.

The Last Emporer,Jordan,"I don’t have a whole lot or ton to add, we coulda talked about this movie for some more obviously theres more content.

I feel like if I knew the story or just the politics around the story going around it, cause now after talking about it, maybe ill read a book about this one day.

as it was happening i was very overwhelmed. i think sam saying crackin the epic movie its a different vibe, its a different experience.

i didnt take a lot of notes, or i was like what the fuck is going on... but not much critique, like just let this thing wash over you like 2 hours 46 minutes, wiht an epic being overwhelmed by it i couldnt think about acting or whatever... just thinking about this is going on.

i dont think it was great or good its definitely not bad, its just not for me at that first watch. i dunno. it will linger for sure. this was a good time.

so i cant say i loved it it definitely was gorgeous to look at. all those people speaking broken english was truly crazy. down the middle 3 turds in a bowl.",3
Strange Brew,Jordan,"I have nothing to say.

I'm sorry I missed the first 30 or 40 minutes of the conversation.

We didn't really have that much conversation about it, but I think from your uh, I think I'm gonna have to defend this shit, which we are gonna have to do that.

I'm a grumpy asshole so this conversation being a week away, this was an interesting, this being a week out with my brain is going to lend me to a be more forgiving of it... I gotta think I take a night before or two nights before and sometimes it can be chore""ish"" and cause sometimes my brain is made of poop i can make it more of a negative in terms of that reaction.

I can remember that now how the redundancy of the jokes was stupid, but it's not as sharp. Yeah uh, trying to remember some of the dumb shit.

Dog roll back up the roof??

Why??

That's comedically up my alley an unexplained stupid thing.

Yeah, there's tons of fun shit regardless of how much the two leads are funny.

Okay hake I dunno why I have to say you are a good boy, I think this movie you brought and love to death this movie gets 3 2 minute pisses from a looney bin.

Equilibrium,Jordan,"equilibrium.

I think ive finally seen it.

Thank you reifenberg for bringing this treasure from your youth and young adulthood into your slightly more adulhood.

Being berated by college friends made me sad.

This movie was made after the matrix, after dark city, before the matrix reloaded, pretty original i would say.

gotta give you that.

i dont know how i feel about this movie right now.

i think mostly i like it. but I think... i didnt like it so much maybe i do like it... its one of those things.

i cant tell if its so bad its good or really that bad.

that's where im teetering.

so much of it is just a swing and a miss at certain things that this genre is doing, something kinda young cinematically.

i dunno what you call this type of dystopian gun shit like jon woo doing gun shit now sams got me reading neurmancer or,

any wa this movie is not very good and i dont think this score really matters at all.

take this exactly how i leave you to be in picking a movie that you lvoe sentimentally im gonna give this 4 taye diggss faceses on marble floors.",4
The Natural,Jordan,"
im gonna go 4444 it 444 s4re

I don’t even know what the fuck im gonna say, sam picking this movie blah blah blah balh I was like dude this movies like fuckin old and boring.

Like a bad old boring baseball movie.

When you said field of dreams, I was like yeah thats what this movie is.

thats a slow ass baseball movie. maybe i needa rewatch it. i was like eeeeh this is just wonna those watevers but then it slaps you with 48 year old playing 18 year old.

then guy gets shot immediately. then theres red herrings and who knows wats and like this movie is swinging for the fences pun intended and it works.

like a lot of times, and when it doesnt it works even more cause it so redicously.

i wanna watch again wanna dissect whats going on maybe someone dunno how to do baseball movie but they did it enought hat it just works so i really enoyed watchin this movie so 4 poisoned little morsel terlets.",4
Little Shop of Horrors,Jordan,"despite what shaggy said that ive actually seen a version of this movie before… don’t remember that so had no knowledge.

The only things I knew about this movie was from brandon scwartz singing the skid row song every episode. I'm a known non-musical kinda guy.

so this movie started and i was like "" i fuckin hate musicals""

but uh, no its a fun movie.

the cgi's really good.

the stuff is crazy.

when it took a turn i was like ""oh this kinda interesting""

im gonna give this 3 glitter lilly funeral arrangements.

Uncle Buck,Jordan,"*accepts*

reif said it good.

His words were similar to words I thought about.

I too was confused about the two sides of the coin that this movie is.

Which I lost my train of thought.

What he said….

John hughs, its so crazy, I know 16 candels and rivers club, but i didnt see a ton of other stuff but knowing he wrote so many fuckin movies in the 80s, or had his fingers in the pie.

my family is a vacation family.

we know all those, so well. those are the quotes that we know back n front, we do em all day. i miss some of dese movies. lil shoppa horrors, train root with hakes house.

missed on our house.

very simple movie and didnt try to like. we talked about it all.

it was a little more straightforward than i thought it would be. was serious but also not serious.

dang.

i think cause i totally woulda been where johnson is because its quotable and gonna go 4 gnat circumcising hatchets.",4
Office Space,Jordan,"office space. Rules.

My sister probably showed it to me, maybe that’s when I saw it.

I was probably 12 when this came out. This movie fuckin rocks I woulda put it up for sentimental season.

I think its hilarious its really good I love this movie you guys should love this movie - 5 bobs.",5
The Karate Kid,Jordan,"The karate kid, from 2010.

this scratched everything I want critically that I want about this podcast we have taken upon ourselves.

Its made me think differently about movies.

For like just movies I wanna enjoy I don’t even think about stars or ratings systems, because im like, that cool.

so this one is like a nice warm cup of milk. that i like to take down multiple times per day. fresh from teat.

its like that warm cup of milk that i like to take it down but i dont like to take it down.

you guys know this movie i hopefully come across. its a sports movie, an underdog movie, its an iconic coming of age kid good timey movies ever and doing a great job of expanding in a lot of ways and making stuff better.

jackie chan is so fuckin good.

sam was talking about us being deprived of future jaden roles, i just love this movie because its bruce lee rabbit hole, him doing this type of acting in this movie and hes not really done it since, and this is a little nugget we get of him doign this and this big budget like crazy movie.

i just always loved this movie.

ill leave you guys with this.

kung foo is in everything we do. it lives in how we take jacket on and put jacket off everything we do is kung foo, 5 jackets-up with attitude.

Jupiter Ascending (re-view),Jordan,"it’s a movie. Ive seen it a few times. Alghout I didn’t finish it this time. I figured about what it coulda been. Had a few more people gone to see it, we would be livin in the watchowskiverse cut, outcry woulda been a little louder. They said lycantent about a dozen times so i gotta go with 5 flying roller blades.",5
Dhoom,Jordan,"um.

Yeah this is a fuckin movie. This is a real movie.

When uh.. Johnson annouced this ""dhoom"" I was like what are you doing. Why are you coming up with this shit.

I was like Gaahd dammit johnson, fuckin johnson what the hell.

I thought this was gonna be about biker boiz but with fast and furious.

But when it started and its for dudes on bikes, wreck a car, zoom around a truck.

Exact beginning of Fast N Furious, and I was like nobody told me this was fastnfurious and then this movie was soo fucking terrible.

But then I'm not screaming every time there's a music scene. I'm kinda like boppin. I dunno I had a good time with this movie. Its a piece of shit. Its not like its so bad its good, but I'm glad i experienced it.

Imma give it 3 removed sunglasses -- err -- glasses.

",3
Inu-Oh,Jordan,"im gonna briefly addon to that. Yes. I think like more knowledge of what we talked about like feudal japan and folkore coulda helped me, but there was a point where im not relaly following the songs that they are talking about too well, so im just gonna let this movie wash over me and be its own thing that way.

but then hearing some people talk about some of the details of the movie i was like that sounds like a fuckin cool thing like i feel like there was stuff kinda glossed over that it woulda been too hard for your brain to kinda reach for that. i wa slike im just gonna check out and let these visual go because thats what my brain was prepared to handle right now.

i could see this being like a if i one day learn more about the culture and come back and revisit this. theres something more being told than i was taking in.

but also like sam im gonna give it 3 cursed elongated arms.",3
Super Mario Bros.,Jordan,"clears throat.

I also saw this. At least once. I don’t think I saw it more than that.

Sam early viewing = icky

my early viewing = oh oh that’s not mario. Alright no, no thank you.

And like disappointed for sure, nowadays this is a terrible movie, this is afuckin bad adaptation. i never desired to go back to it. im super grateful that this happened cause i wouldnadone it on my own. this is, this is not for me. it's not good.

i have to.. i have to admit, im kinda unfortunately on the side of those guys that are like ""this ruined my childhood!""

i didnt see this movie til well after this movie, but like, i fuckin hate this movie and i dont know if theres like peopel --- theres people in it, thats cool but this should not even attempt to be super mario brothers. fuck this movie

barring the suits for 10 minutes, they dont do anything. fucking fire out of guns instead of fire flowers fuck this movie and with that im out 1 screaming martini worms.",1
We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story,Jordan,"*without spice*
We are not on arrakis.

This was fun. This was a movie I had never heard of. And it was pretty silly and ridicuoloous and not necessarily great, but it was fun to talk about.

Its fun to like, remember kids movies that are just like dont worry about the fuckin plot or anything, its just gonna happen. theres gonna be bright colors and entertain, sure you can drill in there and find some fables and words of wisdom, you'll be fine. its gonna eat an hour of their time.

But hopefully becoming a father here in not too long, i was like ""oh that's interesting"" oh i like that, brave little toaster huge movie for me as a kid.

i liked it, and its ridiculous, so lets party with that stupid ass movie: 4 circuses which are a notion with Spiiiiiiiice. bring back scary shit for children.",4
Blood Simple,Jordan,"me personally, I'm not a film critic.

Sam kinda said, I fuckin love watchin movies. I fuckin love them. But. What this apparently is asking me… im not really about.

So I kinda just had to take it for what it was on my first viewing. But I cant see this movie for the first time without seeing other cohen movies and knowing that they done it better in various other moobies.

i didnt come away with super nego vibes but defo underwhelemed (just whelmed) so i did get a little indignant, but sorry for getting so hot in my curdled milkpants.

but its just like... thats not a funny movie.

you watch it on 8th viewing, like ""cool, thats fuckin great"" i just didnt find that to be true (not having seen it 8 times) personally.

so with reif, and im happy to see where this started, thats great. knowing where they went. glad i started there.

so with reif, im going to help bring this ridiculous average down and give it 2 curtainless windows.",2
Gattaca,Jordan,"gattaca was a movie that I thought was a more different movie.

While watching this I had to have a moment with myself after last week's blowup and had to stop thinking what I was gonna get outta this movie and what this movie might be instead of what this movie might give me.

instead of one of those equilibrium type action movies, this is not that at all.

i gotta have a good time with what this is given me.

its kind of this simple commentary on class or genetic engineering. and then its just two white dudes with this goal of ""who fucking cares lol""

the line at the end which maybe to shags point is the most bromance of it its like ""who the fuck gives a fuck about you"" and hes like ""i loaned you my name and you loaned me your dream""

and im like, ""alright that's kinda touching and stuff but im rambling""

3 unmichaelphelpslikebrothers cause i dunno. i didnt particualrly get mad at it or whatever.

thats where you start.",3
Every Which Way But Loose,Jordan,"lithography or whatever the fuck. Set design tip top.

Shag I think you nailed it right there that line you said where they think they can phone it in and it's funny is pretty much my entire takeaway of this movie. We are like ""uh yeah its fun its ridiculous its nice its fun its bad whatever.""

the thing is i think its so lazy or yeah this is funny shit we got a monkey and greatest action actors ever fuckin give us your money.

i dont wanna give them my money, to ape some of you i dont particularly care for it 2 picken pissen fartin and ass pickens.",2

The Big Chill,Daniel,"stand by original statement. Fun watch. Loved those aspects of it. the growth of watching rich white people complain and not have an emotional arc… so many movies I love are white people complaining but this one doesn’t get to the point. doesnt land, but still enjoyed it. 3 dead. hard 3. came in 3 left with 3",3
Drib,Daniel,fanboy of this guy. It totally beat my expectations. You cant make a feature. Challenge to see what he could do. Low expectations. Didn’t make bigger statement. Marking and comedy in general. Much deeper commend did not land end of the day making something original hake and i irianian director even close to making have to give it 4 slaps by body builder: originality and enjoyment,4
Let the Corpses Tan,Daniel,"stuck between 2 and 3. part enjoyed visuals, part was real bored. Wants to like it more based on like being nice to the movie. But my gut reaction was a two. Two dresses getting shot off the maids. Man there were some tired old tropes i dont want to see in art house films",2
The Quiet Man,Daniel,"don’t use this film to beat up other films. I watched this with my old coworkers from the 40s. I put in two oldies but goodies. Crazy week. I walked into this conversation thinking im gonna give ita  3. now talking more about it, goign through notes how 1 noted all the cast members were. continued to go everyone is 1 dimensional. building this straight for no nuance, no reality. gotta stand by my principals that theres not much good other than: hang out, charmyness of ireland
5 spiked cigarettes for the fight scene",2
The Little Prince,Daniel,"my critique is that what we ended on. I wish they would have grounded the old man in the relationship, more hesitant, felt weird. To echo what sams said, I didn’t like arc of mom. Instantaneous realization, man I now see the light. there wasnt an acceptence. little girl great, little prince great, fox great, overall, very rewarding. if i had kids, great this is a movie that deals with some concepts totally on board. positive 3 baobab trees. in between an 3 and a 4",3
The Glimmer Man,Daniel,theres not much more I can probably say tha tyou havent all touched on. I think we paused it to all pee or something. I am loving the clip its moving at. Don’t know where its gonna go in best or worst way. Was a blast to watch. That’s a 1 like bruce lee. there's nothing about this movie that was.. i was entertained. this was not jupider ascending. this had a little bit of heart. the relationship between the two of them. everyonce in a while steven segall works. kinda funny. 2 like bruce lee but betters to be the middle man,2
Masked and Anonymous,Daniel,this movie was the definition of pretention. Taking metaphors and bringing higher meaning into anythign. Sucks when you have literal pretentiousness. Dialouge felt like an 18 year old film school dude watched this. A dude watched a tarantino movie and cohen brothers movie i know what movies are. hard 1. directing a script was not in the cards for this guy.,1
There's Something About Mary,Daniel,"ive seen dog fight scene and hairgel scene. Crazy how little I know about screenshots or whatever. Yeah we said al ot about this movie.t here's some funny funny parts. Car scene. Beggingin scene. End scene. Johnanthon richman scenes. puttin them in th emovie. i couldnt get over the male gaze of this movie. womean are just pedastals that ove sports sex toys rachel got pissed about this movie cant we just watcht his movie. your cutting me off we had a have a whole conversation i was not trying to cut you off ben stiller we gotta watch more it was a whole thing. it ruined a good evening. i couldnt get over the male gaze of the movie which like sucked. man the women characters just sucked. theres movies from the 90s where they know how to write a female. the arc of the gnlish speaking architect changing to a pizza dude even if it didnt work logically i love love loved that whole scene. the fact that she went to ben stiller totally made sense for the time period, would it have been btter i dont know o herees your keys that coulda been a funny bit 2 testicals above the penis",2

They Live,Daniel,"hake: I think this movie would mean you are siskle and ebert john romero
sam: johnson doesn’t like the sex and violence.
Daniel: um. So yeah we talked a lot well actually im going to talk about al ot I knew about this dustin deverette from bayonette had an awesome poster from his work custom made poster always knew abou tit from that the production design of b/w homerun. it was so well done. everytime it went b/w i was mesmerized. to echo johnson with the pacing, i wrote down - ""so slow - but i like"". I liked how it was building up to something but it felt purposeful (minsu the church looking thing). Buildup slow pacing bad payoff. Beautiful. Issue - resistance. felt likesuch a rag tag aspect but it just didnt pay off. because. i felt like it could have been one small scene to flesh them out a bit more. and hten it would of made sense. i cam e in definitely going like this ia four but i painted with ryan today and we were talking abou tit and 3 pairs of sunglasess. i still love it. lub it. charts 3 so much love. not a bad one. ",3
Don't Look Now,Daniel,"um. So yeah. This was like a random pick because Ive always wante dto watch it people talking about it on hereditary. Serious watch. I agree with a lot of you. The literal and story aspect left a lot to be desired. Makes up a lot in its symbolism. not going to take anything at straight value. what it is trying to say with that. once i got my brain on. venice in late fall winter gorgeous time to film. reif. talking about murders being around. I liked the idea of the murders just being around in the setting. this midget is still a representation of the daughter his greif that murdered him. his greif of his daughter murdered him. murders by chance? in on that. donald. julie christie, she was pretty good. totally enjoy it. overall dug it. good horror art film in the 70s. 4 likcs of d suth toopazed mustache",4
Blow Out,Daniel,"jordan, you kinda went through my journey. 

Sam ""I love this guy, he's 20 years old. JJ redick. Mcroberts."" 

Um. So. Yeah overall really loved the movie. Loved the journey. Like jordan said, when it switched to the second half, it lost me for a second but i got on board again. then... because of the ending and the way it built up to that it was a bold choice. the scream bringing it back, i thought was fantastic. you thought it didnt matter but it did. when it ended, oh, it kind of washed over me i kinda thought this film was basically the main character findingt he truth in something and prove that i found the truth but really this is about filmmaking. you think what you are making is the truth, you are trying to show that to the world. John Travolta is the filmmaker, this is the truth! no its not, in denial. this film is showing at the end. the scream that gets used in the terrible B movie is literal truth. no matter how bad or good, there is a glimmer of truth in every film that has been made. 

Jack terry's whole journy is the journey of every filmmaker. you think capital T truth but really you only make a B horror movie you originally thought was truth but it is something. 5 fucking 5! what 5!!!! 5 screams (thassa good scream) WAT!!!!!! this isa masterwork of filmmaking it said the things it needed to,",5
Overlord,Daniel,"um. Yeah going into this movie on Sunday night I didn’t have any expectations other than it was JJ abrams from johnsons text. I thought war zombie movie. Went in with low expectations. Probably enjoyed most of it. Agree with most of our conversation on the flaws. At end of the day, ended well was breezy, parts that worked worked well as an action movie. Yeah I dont; have much else to say. have to give it 3 rotten sons of bitches.

Sam: I've decided next year I'm going to get back.

Shag: They made a movie. They completed a thing. I'm very proud of them for making a movie, paying people. Watching this in 2020 was like real rough. We have learned the art of telling stories with more depth and nuance than this. This movie I was on my computer, my phone as much as as i was Watching this movie. I do appreciate the opening. Then the juxtopisition of the party at th bbq, so strong. Thought they would lean more into that. Mayb eyou guys picked up more than i did.

Path of female now shes just an object. but like um, yeah it was just en dof the day so heavy handed...

Not a big body horror dude. It was just rough. so. 2 eaten hearts out of a hand.",2
Phantasm Two,Daniel,"missed some convo this is a movie where the conversation is better than the movie itself. Fun to talk about. Sad I missed the sex scene talk. Going to town with the underwear on again. WHOOOOOO. She is like a robot.
Ben: ""shes tall man""
Sam: ""inappropriate joke""
Shag: so the conversation about this movie great i suffered from watching this movie middle of the day on monday because the front part of the week is so busy so i just had to fit it in it was a lunch movie not time of day good. beginning was hilariously confusing with the double house blow up. sort of doing an adventure not explain.
so much heart in all of the good guy characters. sadly the female was not fleshed out well at all.
the tall man and his minions, great villian.
take away a lot of scenes from this movie in my head in a positive head. as a whole:
this is. uh. double quad shotgun.",2
Pumping Iron,Daniel,"cool. Um. I watched this with erin and joe at their house. Wish I could have paid more attention to that. This is a doc style that I love. The fly on the wall hangout doc… they aren't made as much anymore… I drew some comparsons of the vibe: paris is burning.
Vibe is the same. hanging out in the scene to let them know about this amzing thing is happening. beautifyl bceause no agenda. we think this thing is so cool, no agenda to it, just need to dcument the people doing and you will be totally encompassed by th ething they are doing. i love a doc that knows wen to cutt off.
loved the ending. him retiring. felt like ""the last dance"" coming off ""the last dance"". docs knew when to do it cause it was the peak of arnold. not a lot of critiques as a movie... not a lot of conflict or other stuff... super solid as docs go. 4 people if who are dogs would bite people. 

for dogs by dogs.

lol",4
Election,Daniel,"so yeah this conversation has been great I'm so happy this went this well.

Picked it not knowing a whole lot about it. It is in the criterion collections. Oh young resse witherspoon, young matthew broderick this could be fun 90s mtv movie. i think it delivered on. it was way more creative than i thought this movie ever could be.

Noone is wholly good or wholly bad. it is very eastern philosophy, characters have flaws, good, bad stuff, they brought this to that movie. it was so much fun to walk.

one more thing we havent talked baout. ahead of this time dealing with priveleged white men, midwest white men that don't deal with any diversity they think they can deal with anything. i agree with johnson the statutory rape was offputting, the way they took him down so quickly.

the slow demise was fun to watch of matthew broderick. can do it all piss in front a a tree and cehat on his wife because of the color of his skin and his gender because they were in omaha. this movie was swimmin in trim. paul for the win. 4 juicy fruits outta fishy bowls.

sam: hot offa presses",4
Party Monster,Daniel,"I agree with hake and sam and a lot of whateveryone said.

I did hit a wall with this movie. Once I knew how bad acting and style, you kinda hit a wall where it's like oh we gonna continue this. It wrapped up you were fatigued by the end of this movie.

once you get away from it, i realized this movie is not meant for me. the story it was tyring to tell i knew nothing about. i was an outside individual. i took that into watching this thing and um. at the end ofthe day i was doing the same thing jordan was. i was researchingt he real story and what it did.we talked so much about th ereal individuals and the real scene. in the end it succeeeded what it wanna do.

at the end of it thats unfair. i think it did what it neded to do. 3: money success fame and glamours.",3
Gone in 60 Seconds,Daniel,"I watched this in highschool at least once or twice and I remember it being decent, but not loving it. We rewatched it and I understood 100% why.

I think there was a lot of.. I t was funny. It was  a very funny movie when It comes to everyones portrayals. i remember cage being more unhinged in my brain, but that pulled me back in my enjoyment. like we talked about the skinsuit. i wanted more cage.

i felt like the buildup was a bits low bfore the heist happend. i loeved the cops. the villan was terrible. they did not write him well at all and i was very dissapointed with the villan. i remaner the villan being better.

the score was a big pet peeve of mine becuase it just forced you to feel things that the acors were not doign.

at the endo fth edat it was a blast to watch loved the characters in the buildup. this is not gonna get a juipe for review. 2 lazercutpoopiedogkeesthatigotmyjollysoffwith.

i remember talking with hake and accidentally watching early 2000s movies and i must just have a weird i just dont get the aesthetic. it sucks.",2
Dangerous Liaisons,Daniel,"clears throat.

To echo a lot of us, I thought the intro was very exciting. I was very excited to watch a period piece. It set us up to watch a funny and satiracl period peiec about how wealth treats sex and each other.

Lacking consistency. lacking tone. is this funny? is this serious? the movie ""the favorite"" was better.

once i thought about ""the favorite"" i realized this movie was bad.

the last act was strong. jordan made a comment earlier. it ended too quick and was getting good with the war betweeen the two but ended with swordfight. end was battle of ugliest two beign like ""to sex or not to sex, to manipulate or not to manipulate""

this movie deserves 2 double wig malkovitchz. monolith here.",2
Diamonds Are Forever,Daniel,"I have second leaset bond experience. This is also my first pre pierce brosnan bond in full. Which is ridiciulous. I know.

Was sean connery the very first bond?

Y:

N:

i knew this one was bad.

he got $1.2 big ones in 1971 to do this movie. it cost $7 big ones to make it.

i have yet to see a more phoned in movie performance wise than this. this was insane how little anyone gave a shit when the cameras were rolling. i was like...

What. Am I watching?

Everyone from the bottom to the top gave a shit about this movie... and you could tell. as a viewer you begin to not care along with everyone else...

But it is a fun watch.

I do admit that the moon scene we rewatched was fantastic.

The moonbuggy with the tricycles...

Shout out to irish / italian funeral boys. the beginning part of the movie was all fine.

Conversation did not disappoint.

The Bad News Bears,Daniel,"I was really excited to watch this because I havent watched one in a while. Excited to watch baseball, old school film.. At that.

Right of the bat I nkew I was super excited. The hand held camera and long takes gave it some realness and authenticity that iwas just really excited about.

and. i lvoed how timeless this was with the kids just wanted to hav efun. that was just super timeless.

loved that. and.

when i was thinkin about it this mirrored real life in a lot of ways with um...

noone goes through a huge transformation.

The Neon Demon,Daniel,"I think it would be better if I go. Lump me in with this group. Johnson at the end witches wild card kevin talk…

I am in the hake and sam camp where I was excited to at least try and appreciate this film for what it was. Gorgeous visual journey, rachel we gonna watch this at the cinema.

the beginning the acting was such a choice, then it just kept making decisions in which it lacked creativity and the pacing wore on me even thought i have thick skin for that.

the music, the visuals anammorphic lenses was incredible everyone looked amazing.

at the end of the day the symbolism was too heavy handed and i think i hate this director and its a white man directing a movie about women so fuck off dude. 2 trifecta cannibals.",2

you believe them

i loved how it was shot

i agreed with sam about austrailia chill enough dipped toes

i am on the side of th efence that at the end where it jumped the shark i agree with ben becuase it jumped the shark at the right time. i loved the fact that it was chill early. 3rd act was breath of fresh air for me. i was gonna i m gonna give it 4 frostythrownoffacuppa",4

so I have to . Agree with um, everyone else, sorry I am buying a house.

um. I agree with everybody who has gone. i was really kind of thinking of more thought out humor but it was... the same gag for all of 80 minutes which got old and i was bored. but talking about it with you guys was a hell of a lot of fun to remember.

watching with headphones and a laptop is not the way th emovie should be digested. the soundtrack was great.

the peyote scene was great. happy we rewatched that.

juxtaposed against the rest of the movie it made it stand out even stronger because of that.

A Prairie Home Companion,Daniel,"I did not realize we had that tally just overally point.

So. I, whenever you pick your movie you are just nevous about who people are going to receive it. Im not nervous anymore about picking the movie and receiving now im worried about the conversation.

Django,Daniel,"I don’t have a lot to say about this movie because we talked a lot about it.

My main thoughts was:

it was jarring at first poppin into this dubbed sphagetti western world, which I don’t hav ea lot of experience watching westerns.

once i settled in, i really fell in love with the scene and the world it created. especially th emain characther.

revisiting the fight scenese made me. hand held cameras gave some authenticity to this fake world.

i loved some of those action scenes. it was funny but at the same time the main character had a lot of grit and a lot of interesting character vibes going on.

i can see the influence. i can see why people chose this as a way for making future movies.

ive been watching a lot of sun dance movies and i had to watch this in two parts. i was so excited to return to the world of django.

something about watching a movie from 1966 i just had to jump in gonna ive it 4 coffins that were once filled with a machine gun but was now filled in gold.

a lot of holes to shoot bullets out of",4
Metropolis,Daniel,"um.

Ill try to keep this review simple

overall I think I enjoyed the watch of this film maybe more than the rest of indivduals.

I don’t have a huge anime backlog. That being said, the animation, I viewed through a nostalgiac lense.

i kind of oddly enjoyed the animation of this movie. not bcause it was good but because it was a moment in time

the movie endd and i was trying to figure out a lot of the symbolism.

im excited to let this stew, to figure out more of what they are going for.

then this conversation happened. nothing came to me, nothing came to you guys. robots, singularity.

when i got done with this film my gut reaction was a 4, but then 3.5 we dont do half so 3 uncles who dont give a shit about their nephews.

i really liked the music that was not big band but it was big band. glen miller white people but actaully not

i enjoyed th emusic choice. this was very cowboy bebop. rebop of cowboy bebop rebop of cowbop.

that main cowboy bebop theme.

jordan butchers cowboy bebop theme

japan is obsessed with jazz music. there is a whole storyline in treme about a trombone. etc.

Mr. Jealousy,Daniel,"this is the firs tmovie I brought to movie club that I have seen.

Against my usual pricinpals.

Because zina has been watchign so many nb movies I was thinking aout his early stuff and how much fun.

Kicking and screaming I hated in college, i was like these guys are bimbos but in 2016 i was like fuck.. we are these people. i became these people.

perspective is everything. mr jealousy was hard i had to buy the dvd on ebay back in 2016 or 2017 when i originally watche dit.

its been a minute its been like 4 years. i remember watchign it and digging it and understanding the flaws.

why not bring it to movie club.

it was a super enjoyable watch i was like oh man are we going to to be able to talk about this are people going to like this.

at th eend of the day i loved peoples insights talking about it.

the therapy sessions and its comment on therapy. i really loved i felt like it was fun he came to therapy as a lie but they all benefited kinda from it. i loved the hyperbolic nature of this movie everything was extreme and exaggerated.

it caused noah b to go in a hole for 8 years.

um. my logical brain wants to give it a 3 but my personal enjoyment is easliy a 4. group therapy sessions by peter bogdonovich.",4
Mars Attacks,Daniel,"I have never gone first.
Mars attacks. Very excited to watch this moovie. Because ive never seen it. I didn’t even know tim burton directed this movie.

This movie seemed like an SNL skit that was in movie form. Watching the cast I was pretty pumped. it was a cultural moment that i missed when i was kid. and when i watched this i was like... this is a reverse allegory for our treatment of the native americans:

mars comes in is like ""we wanna be your friends"" oh wait never mind we are going to murder all of you.

then i found out that the song that saved everybody was called ""the indian love call"" and the fact that the kid that won looked like a native american and was from a military family and made a tee-pee reference and i was like oh my god. tim burton

then we looked up the cards and i wa slike... oh tim burton was just referencing some cards..

all jokes aside, i do think tim burton was playing with a lot of things and at the end of the day he liked subverting everything, whether that was our treatment of the native americans, action movies, being a first rate movie star at 96. he sprinkled it in everything and at the end of the day i wanna hang out and party with tom jones for real. this was 3 attacks on mars. by mars. sorry.",3
WR: Mysteries of the Organism,Daniel,"I will give a review from my mouth rather than my butt.

Super interesting pick. Arguably the most art house film we have done by far.

It was a collage, which I respect.

Happy I saw it.

It was interesting I watched it I was very tired.

my biggest takeaway from this film was an aspect i was trying to read into it but sam said dont analyze it too much my takeawy was the opposite of: the phrase: everything looks perfect from far way.

i say everythign looks perfect zoomed in. sex is perfect zoomed in sex manifesets itself through politics whether thats communism or the american dream

for me when i lose s dr recih politics american paradoxiacal maybe he was getting do that point maybe you cant extrapolate even a human truth human politics or communism east v west you can i dont know where im going with thsi blah blah blah 3 sex balls soccer balls 3 sex balls vibes thats where i am.",3
Monkey Bone,Daniel,"happy quiet man day.

Had no idea about this movie. Had no idea about how little of films henry sellick directed. Stop motion takes a long time.

When I saw he directed I was like this is crazy and I hav eno idea about this movie.

we presesed play it started happening it was a 2001 movie where its between 1990s and 2000s which is a weird vibe.

once we got downtown i was like... cool i get where we are going. but overall it just didnt explore it enough

it was bad. brendan frazier was at some parts had quircky cartoon comic book drawler but also he tryin to be married. it didnt wrk.

but then chris katan come and save the day. it was a 5/5 star scene in this movie. most brilliant snl skit in your life.

at the end of the movie rachel was like was that so good and then misdirect, amazing scene. this holds up isolated organ donor organ donor team gymnast take it out and so good. this movie had a lot of potential.

this is the quintessential wednesday night movie. this is why we get together. this is why we talk about movies. this is why we do this. so good so bad at the same time. 2 kidneys out of dead kris katan.",2
Magic Mike,Daniel,"I was very excited about jordans selection of magic mike.

Ive heard a lot of allure around the series, and in hindsight I relize its around the second one. i kne what to expect.

I did not expect a real movie. Halfway through I was like they are trying to make a real geunine indy moive.

i was like this is supposed to be one thing

the hoook around this love hate relationship with this movie i wa slike they try to make indy movie about male strippers in florida but there are bad steps and cliches they made such as the drugs the sidekick ya know.

overall the heart was there. we realized the heart was there in the rgiht place you gotta appreciate the performances overallwere great except the kid

because of that love hate relationshipwith this im so excited for this next one but i was happy i watched it and im a soderburt fan

DRUK (Another Round),Daniel,"so this is my pick.

I was torn about picking this movie I was the firs tone pick off season 8. I remember all of you alls watching it and I wish it was with you.

It dips the toes into the arthouse cinema waters but the minute I pressed play i was like okay, we will hav ea lot to stalk about this was my second time watchin.

the second time watching it i was like this is a beautiful film about male friendships dealing with a middle aged rut

martin: adolescent kids wife emotionally far away

nicolash: new kids so eh was in a rut

peter: never in deep relationship

tommy: divorced

all delt with male middle aged ruts well minus peters in a great way a fantastic part of this movie.

its story of alchohol is beautiful: its realistic, you got for 4 friends who deal with alchohol in a celebratory way but we can f-up our lives a little bit but one of them doesnt know how to... its a realistic story and i love that.

is alchohol gonna ruin our lives? no. gonna make us fuck up some shit? yeh.

gotta give it 5 with a point in front of it B.A.C.",5
Lapsis,Daniel,"low budget movies thrive in traditional indy fair.

Coming of age, romantic comedy, and then… sci-fi

I was excited about this being a sci-fi movie, open to different reality, different dimensions.

First act came in super heavy with how exciting this movie can be.

i think this conversation fleshed out ideas that could make this movie 110 times greater than what we watched.

at the end of the day this movie had some great performances.

it iddnt stick the landing, i gotta put it in perspective, im happy they are making movies like this the director is working. i dont think ill return to it i am happy i watched it 3 out of extraordianry pillow fights three of them",3
The Skin I Live In,Daniel,"I cannot count, ever.

So ive seen a loto f this guys directors movies. This guys movies. Because of that bulter screen we did. I like a lot of them but hes enver done a complete homerun for me but hes made some… off ones.

This guy is like a very prolific filmmaker and this was his horror. and it was regarded as a very interesting movie when it came out.

a lot of things have already been said, but i felt like he brought a lot f his mello drama and convoluted drama about this extrastraneous bs but this one makes it worse.

it could have been a simple film about grief and loss and make it stronger.

he has to make a lot of movies:

what if, we had this crazy plastic surgeon that reverses a guys sex, without his consent? isnt that crazy?

lets reverse engineer the story.

rape. ok what would make someone so made but oh have this wife run away.

he had a good idea and he reverse engineered. antonio banderaze was great gift to screen his face.

Sorcerer,Daniel,"very bummed I had to come in so late, we were running an event really late for erin. Haron college. Iupui. Erin herin.

Bummed I had to miss the beginning of the conversation. Thank you hake for picking this movie, theres a lot of allure around thsi movie that id idnt even know about it.

i feel like this movie was picked at the right time. casavetti and malaya nd enjoying the language of 70s filmmaking. the verite filmaking style and the vignettes were fantastic, felt documentary style.

and then, um, i loved how these characters were never redeeming, we are just going to show these guys down and out. they dont even value their lives. they are trying to get out kindof, but the film showed they are half heartedly trying to get out.

this movie was like, well lets just give them a game sot hey have meaning again even they dont have anything to live for. speaking with safety brothers they would be this movie is the fucking beast.

characters that dont mean anything but im gonna tell their story anyways.

the lack of exposition i was totally down for, i dont need any of that, this movie has aged because they dont fill gaps. theres so many holes. holes make for great conversation to argue about what they mean. room to think about what that means. filmmakers that let the audience think about things compliments the audiences ability to think about things and not be strapped into a box and in hindsight i loved this movie it was. blah blah 4 drips of nitroglycerine 70s movie rule they are so good. i was in it.",4
Shogun Assassin,Daniel,"coming off of reifs review, I 100% agree I thought this movie was a lot more fun and funny than I was planning on.

I couldn’t tell whether it was purposeful, but in turn it was fun, like the main character we all talked about he seemed like a goofball but at the same time he had it all together.

as a lot of peopl eliked this movie and liked the dub, i was excited to watch it because i loved django. it was such an immediate disappointment when the kid was narrating.

when he stopped and we got to live in the moment, the kid just kept pulling me out and it was so anti what the original filmmakers were trying to do.. so that was tough.

this was a nice seguay to sorcerer. i love it it had the 80s music but over explanation.

here's sorcerer that did it more my style shogun assassin had the same ingredients but didnt do it my style.

the women were my favorite and the kimono eject button got 5 swords. im gonna give this 3 ballz.",3
Driven,Daniel,"Driven.

This is what movie nights are made for. I feel like I pressed play on this movie after being on the track and  I was very excited for this conversation.

Watching this movie was not as enjoyable as thinking about the question but it was still a blast.

This is the hallmark movie of racing movies.

Some of the action scenes were a lot of fun but oh my god this dripped so much of 2001 and um. i thought some of the body language froms ome of our actors were solid.

you could just tell that the uh. dialogue was just slwoing us down and

i wish i would have saved the video game reference. sorry i spill

cgi was worst thing i saw in my life.

Exit Wounds,Daniel,"frisbee golf conversation.

Okay yes. I agree with a lot of said sataments. When I got hinto this movie we jumped into the deep end of action movie.

Then what the fuck is happening movie.

Then it kinda leveled out and I was okay cool, we are just in the shit storm.

mainly the dmx internet bubble moment, i thought this was oddly a very black positive film.

dmx is a self made man. tk owns his own club. partner has wife kid thing.

also defund the fuckin police film. we got corrupt cops. dmx trying to reveal that in 2001, right around 9/11 before all cops must be positive.

but then, we have the character that ruins this whole goddamn movie because he is ""i will break all rules to do whatever because I'm a white man""

but then i thought that steve segall just represents conservative american trumpism. this is the united states, left vs right. if we can work together like steve segall and dmx, maybe united states of america is great.

we can work togehter and meet libertarian crazy people in the middle.

this movie had a lot of problems but holy shit i had a lot of fun.

Pink Flamingoes,Daniel,"hakes pick of jackass 0 was an interesting choice for movie club.

I just had like a… so watching this movie very uncomfortable and not an enjoyable watch.

Having this conversation about that movie has been a nice little um… uh. reinforcement of why i am trying to open an art house cinema in general.

the idea you can watch literally anything, and as long as you can talk about it with friends it can make anything watching worthwhile

it was pretty cool watchign and talking about it. you know if you can enjoy with people. i think we saw john waters having a blast on screen with his pevert friends.

this movie was not made by john waters to rate it all, so its a very tough rate. so... im just going to go.. going to give it a 2 dancing buttholes.

and that is my review.

how do you rate something thats not supposed to be rated?

its weird.",2
Three The Hard Way,Daniel,"similarities with the beginning. Leaving town. Got a cat. Had the island installed to day. Had to make six hours to shoot something for the second day in the row.

Im gonna get this brown sugar.

I click play. I watched like 15 minutes. okay... go do somethin, email somethin, 30 minutes. do this thing.

as i kept going, more and more stuff to write down.

the minute the movie got down... i started capturing scenes for the jupies. the songs. great vibe.

like man... this is what movie club night needed for this pick.

weve done some great stuff, exit wounds, pink flamingoes... this was needed.

we broke it down in chrono. just laughing about all those scenes.

Mallrats,Daniel,"ok. Im gonna go.

I was gonna tell a story.

So I totally forgot in highschool we just got our 16 year old birthday, so ryan thrower, josh grabner and myself was like. Dude you want to go to indianapolis? I was like, sure.

Got to the mall, got an anty anns pretzel, drove our asses home.

so this movie had a lot of that energy where you have nothing to do but go to malls. that's my relationship with malls.

so the movie. Ive only seen this movie once, so this was the second time.

i was like ok we gonna see a lot of problematic stuff. it did a good job of setting up problematic stuff and then negating it with a joke or dodging it.

kevin smth did a good job there. loved that.

i think this movie would this movie been better wth a less budget? if he didnt have success from clerks? chilled out, the dichotomy of the independentness of this with lack of acting but with higher budget swings were an issue for me.

i think there oculd have been a really great tonal movie if the budget was a little lower if that makes sense.

on top of the ending, the both characters do not deserve the ending that they got.

those were my two beefs.

lots of strong female characters which was awesome

Ishtar,Daniel,"Sunday I hosted my buddy dustin and his coworkers and friends for his movie club, and they do something what we do and they do what we do.

They do hyper extreme, like only criterion collection. We watched hyper intense movie on a sunday afternoon, the coversation with them was good.

then to sit down and watch this, was just such a breath of fresh air, you guys pickin movies like this, so i just came at this lovin this cause i just need it!

just talking with you guys, pullin clips for the jupies, this felt like a long form snl sketch. agree that warren beatty was not the right choice for this movie.

i wish charles groden did more stuff cause i love that dude.

i just loved the whole goddamn thing, there's only 1 score to give this thing, but its my movie so im going to give it the same score but TIMES TWO BABYY, given it a 4.",4
Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000,Daniel,"I can add to this.

Most sci-fi movies are made so we can creatively um. Use metaphors to apply to our real life, so I thought that this was gonna do, with bad action and bad premise.

But then it just went off… no use of metaphors at all, no creativity, but i do agree with sam because the first half of th emovie its just a bad sci-fi, but theres stuff that could have grown into soemthing.

but it iddnt.

the battlefield was not on earth, but it was inside my mind, so im going to give it 1 psychlo genocider",1
Waiting to Exhale,Daniel,"forrest whitaker did these girls bad.

Holly, thank you for bringing this movie into my life.

I feel like… I was critical of this movie in the fact of how it portrayed:

conversations, hang movies (I love hang movies)

im like this movie isnt doing it right? this is forrest whitaker.

i felt about. this film came out in '95, we are portraying complicated female black characters on screen, and how beautiful this had been.

like we are all a bunch of white dude, like all the social construct theres so many complicated black female characters, but at the time? what else was there?

so watching it at the time, this is the first time we are seeing all black women interacting. really cool.

you give this film a different director?

the sky's the limit. give it to a black female director.

gonna give this a 3 enduring friendships :)

Predestination,Daniel,"
when uh, rachel was my guest pick, she mentioned this movie, predestination.

So going into it, the way she talked about it I had some history with it.

She talked about how its some kind of fucked up movie, and you shake your head.

In watching it, i was kinda sucked in, and when i found out that ethan hawk was in it, i had some faith.

i think he was able to bring you into this low budget sci-fi, if you take him out of this movie it could easily go off the rails, but because his performance is so good he brings you into this low budget movie.

i totally love low budget sci-fi movies, which it does.

theres some cheap aspects like shooting in the 1950s and everything.

wel all talked about it. loved simplicity but hated the terrorist bomber wipe solve something super simple becuase of this it kept it in this loop.

this movie is a paradox in itself. this movie is itself. this movie is the same. in that aspect it is 3 flaming faces.",3
Mamma Mia,Daniel,"Ok, Obviously this has been a busy week getting ready to host all ya'll. @ nites spread this. It was aa funny figuring out the schedule for our cinema and also finding the joy in the opposite side of the movies. These movies are valuable in a totally different way. The guys voices are terrible and maybe thats the point. I wish they would have edited more of the cuts. Rewatching it I can't be too positive or 2 negative. So 3 TBDs.

Brilliantovaya ruka,Daniel,"first off does anyone have neezer's number.

I work with michael neezers number. I want to be like, ""yo"".

Russian movie.

I did not know what we were getting into when I first pressed play.

It was super jarring. Did not know what was going on. Agree with sam.

i felt like i was out of the loop, and hake put it in wonderful context, we watch a lot of art house movies that are programmed in the US for a reason.

they are slower, westernized. It was nice to watch a 1960s film that's not high art but mainstream.

it was tough to follow, because i felt like i was missing a lot of stuff, made for niche audience that was russia, not us.

my biggest critique was that they did not let anything breathe. maybe thats western critique. then someone would commandere that and maybe that's ametaphore for the soviet gubmit.

there are some great scenes throughout this film, hard to stick with it, still enjoyed the watch, love how i have context now for this film. gonna have to give it dos robes with pearl buttons.",2
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,Daniel,"Shag: As the probably non most non superhero person here in this group. I am at least very, I've seen every batman movie now minus the justice league stuff. This was something I was familiar with. It was super refreshing watching batman in an animated situation. I got to rewire my brain. I got to go back to where it started with comics and watch the comic come alive. I think its portrayal of greif is why it's touted so strongly. He tried to have a normal life but his geif stopped not only his but his partners life. It was a multidemensional multifacited way. I enjoyed it, was it perfect no, but 4 bat boomarangs, in honor of reif.

Victor/Victoria,Daniel,"ill go.

I was, so I was raised on musicals. Like the music man who played toddy. His like. Probably most famous performance.

When he entered the movie, his voice brought back my childhood watchin movies with my mom and sisters. Loved the early vibe.

but.

the energy was just... i was not jiving so much with the energy. i was excited to watch an '82 movie, but it was doing a reflection of famous musicals in the 50s and 60s.

its content was so groundbreaking in a lot of ways, it was incredible how deep in the movie with no problematic moments.

elevating the gay community in france, elevating these characters in the 80s just blowin my mind.

sorry reif. do you think that they were hiding behind the veil of france, oh they are french, the one guy from chicago is like, they are hiding behind this french bullshit.

we can make thsi movie thats progressive that's french bullshit. bullshit.

the whole end is like we are gonna build the people up just to knock them down. men need to be men, women need to be women, the gay people can be french weirdos.

im like what the? they build it up and then, im at a weird crossroads with this movie, even 80s so 3 norma's small rages.",3
Drop Dead Gorgeous,Daniel,"riding the jordan wave.

I was really excited to watch this because my coworkers were specifically talking about this movie two weeks or a week before megan brought this.

I don’t knoww hat the fuck they were talking about.

Didn’t know it was a mockumentary, watching it in 1999 i was blown away with how it predated how everything we watch now is in the mockumentary vein.

they are fake and use the medium that is very funny

predated a lot of funny stuff, joke after joke after joke.

so happy this movie is in my brain for references and jokes, cause its so damn funny.

if you take away anorexic girl, mentally handicapped brother and a little bit of the peodofile, you get the perfect movie that beats up midwestern beauty queen culture.

with that critique i gotta give this 4 melted beercan hands.",4
The American Astronaut,Daniel,"okay, excited for guest season was great. We saw a lot of fantastic movies that we never would have scene.

It was poetic that the last movie was jeremiah because it’s the perfect reset everything and when jeremiah picked im like why do I know this movie.

i emailed the director of this movie back in the day, cause dusty wanted to see this movie. you could email the guy and get a screening, but he never answered because the website was too old.

public house cinema and i have to agree from sams first comment, the minute this movie started im like, this is so jeremiah its david lynch low budget musical.

the music, feeling, i was exactly in the mood for this movie. i really appreciated that it knew what it was trying to be, just a weird bizarre movie. the minute it went to being a dive bar in the solar system i never really got off the train.

theres some problems about it for sure but it knows about them so its good. this is easily a true 3.5, in the context of how much i enjoyed them, 4 cigarrettes",4
Bones,Daniel,"didn’t know what I was getting into wit hthis movie, other than snoop dogg and a horror movie.

When it started, it was like turning on a lifetime movie, ut yet.. It had a lot of wonderful things to say, ushc as gentrification, race identity, family... but it was a slog for like the first hour of this 90 minute movie.

i literally paused it to go pee, and tehre were 30 minutes left. right before bill walked into the room to find maurice dead. and then bones manifested himself.

and then we wtached a new movie. that movie was snoop dogg running around killing a bunch of people, holding heads for comic releif. and rachel and i were like... this movie rocks.

in this movie there is a beautiful 4 star film that is the last 30 minutes. there is also a terrible 2 star lifetime movie in the first 60 minutes. but at the end of the day its a 3 spooky maggotrainhouse.",3
Zombi 2 (Zombie Flesh-Eaters),Daniel,"I had no idea what the hell I was getting into, since this movie has 18 names. But I realized that I came into this session warmer to this movie than everyone here minus the pople that reviewed.

I was like pretty much enjoyed the movie.

I think ive realized im totally seduced by 70s filmmaking. like i am all in, the grit the shittiness of it, the sound track.

the storyline was secodary and i didnt really care, the experience of the zombie movie and the soundtrack and the gore.

i realized i didnt need plot to enjoy a movie.

i dont have any history like really enjoying a zombie movie, so i dont have any backlog of analyzing it against other zombie movies.

i enjoyed a lot of the feedback, i let the movie wash over me, the critical eye gave me good insight.

end of the day i am very very seduced by 70s filmmaking and the sound track so 3 tits out scuba divers.",3
Tales From the Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood,Daniel,"ill go.

So there's some bad movies that age well, because you remember all these fun parts.

And then there's some bad movies that don’t. I got done with this movie and I was like… yeah its kinda fun.

But then with this conversation I was like. wait. this movie is bad. anyways, my favorite part was dennis miller acting alongside dennis miller the reverend and then dennis miller the little person.

all playing the same person.

its been a minute since ive given a movie this, lets give it 1 skin express to tuna town.",1
Possession,Daniel,"I'm still struggling with my score.

I remember watching this with a packed theatre and it was really special, to watch it with this many people.

Try to watch it wash over me, but the minute it ended I knew I wanted to rewatch it.

What we just watched, the uncomfortability, wanted to revisit it. and knowning a lot more context, how this was made and the director going through a divorce and all that stuff.

i was just watching this as the first time i watched it for me the cinematography was a 5 of 5. the camera movements was just incredible.

i wanted to watch to absorb the rest of the acting, as a person who was married and has had someone come home and say that they are no longer physically with you and have moved on. this movie makes sense.

this movie was made by an alien, but that's what makes it good.

this makes total sense. he was just, he was having an exorcism of what he was feeling through this movie.

its kind of a miracle that this movie exists, its insane, it should not have been made, its just insane.

we are just gonna go with a 5 feathers.",5
Misery,Daniel,"so, I uh, did this week has been very busy. And. I could only watch this movie today and thought this was gonna be chill.

Then I had to change the bulb out of the large projector in cinema 2 and that took all afternoon. So I watched the first 30 minutes at noon, and then i crammed the last bit right before the call (thats why the email was late).

watching a movie in that sporadic stressed out environment is tough, but this movie even through all that i was still sucked in and engaged through this movie, you could be 1 foot stuffed in and one foot mental state to pay attention.

the reason why i brought up the flaws was like we are all talkin bout it but we cant really beat it up too much.

yeah. is it a perfect movie? no but its damn near close to it. so i gotta give it 4 bitchly cow feeeds. corns. gosh i got it burned into my brain.",4
Someone's Watching Me!,Daniel,"after whatcing black crhistmas athte can can and seeing how excited john carpenter kind of a movie made around the same time as halloween.

Black christmas he brough into this so that I am a good twin peaks fan and fire walks fan david lynch restrained in tv is forced to be creepy in network tv so i was hoping for that, and we did.

carpenter with tv restrained was good lead performance in character and weird whacknoness made it go down smooth

its progressive for 78 in some aspects which is cool we talked about the plotholes so 3 almost grabbed shards of glass for me.",3
Phantom of the Paradise,Daniel,"by winslow himself.

You guys have said so much I wish I could put some thoughtful new takes on this but I thikn you guys have said them and they are all valid.

I think everything about this movie when I picked it to hitting play, not knowing what i was getting into , the crazyiness of the film, its 70s sloppiness was heightened. i was just catching so much stuff like daft punk so much taken from this movie.

i guess ill keep this short like ryan not too favorable sat with him a while, i enjoyed the movie a lot today thinking about it, everything about this movie is just so god damn funny in hindsight. just so ridiculous.

i htink i gotta give it 4 beef.",4
The Lady From Shanghai,Daniel,"this review is actually about citizen kane.

Oh waow.

Sam: This is the last episode of moobie club. Reif deletes the excel sheet.

I was excited to review when hake picked an old film. Havent seen too much orsen welles movies. Ive seen a couple.

im not a orsen wells-stan at all. I saw citzen kane, its okay. its a moobie.

i have 3 movies from the 40s that I lubbed, but orsen wells doesnt feel like the same energy or vibe that i like from that era.

don't love the stuff I've seen, totally love and respect what he does.

innovates and changes how cinema works, which is incredibly cool.

as a moobie, we talked about the issues and the problems, people took the great parts and added onto it to influence movies, and you cant take that away from future generations.

peronsally it was a 3 sweaty excitable hyper-close-up grizbees.

Naked Lunch,Daniel,"am I talking quietly?

What can I say about bug movie. I was excited to watch a david cronenburg movie fro sure. I have convo with artist and he loved this movie. He said "" I cant explain it, I dig william s burroughs""

if you are into william and movie, i learned about cronenburg. this is impressive it exists and toes line. sadly im not in world lunch or burroughs.

we dont do half sips here, for me it's totally a 3 and half sip film. lean back in movie club fashion 3 sips of cronenburg juice.
",3
Go,Daniel,"
I went to this movie with no expestacions and its th ebest way.

This movie is the blast. I don’t know what yall talkin bout the minute this movie edited in a way it geve it depeth

had nuance for this age. Whole point was trap you in 1 way of story telling and then pull back like mlm like white guy is racist but actually society is racist.

expectations = shitty

actual = enjoyed

yeah im gonna age well as a fun movie.

so go movie. 4 crunchy herbal rave-shits next.

i didnt eat popcorn for a literal decade after i saw next. ",4
Riders of Justice,Daniel,"this conversation was good cause I expect this film to be a certain way with mixed emotions watching it.

Things have been tired, taking care of dog and sleep deprivation and talking about stuff watever same boat.

I will use this review to like discuss so heres how my day went. thank you all for being here.

my car is stuck inna mud.

cant drive my car outa parking spot. sposed to go with dog and rachel to vet but had to drive bmw to do tax meetings with lizzes mom and got outta there and came back to can can for projectors and it was raining all day

all tops were pooling water, take it home didnt work and mud hands. shovel home and riders of justice.

spigot to wash hands and water no come and then water running outside of the siding of the house

rachel is outside watching and im walking kimchee and then i run inside and busted pipe in our basement. water everywhere and water shutoff is panic mode

i was told where water is. i find it, shut it off. water everywhere in basement

im going to go back to work now so i drove to work and got that done.

3 chubbies

dang shag.",3
Broadcast News,Daniel,"piggyback - I picked this movie exactly why hake said it. He said he would not normally watch this movie.

Something I normally wouldn’t do, and watch with friends, I was bummed out this was our movie pick. This was way more than noah than I thought it would be.

i thought it would be funny or going for something cause of the clout in the cinema universe.

i was like, this is just a movie.

i still enjoyed, like at the time it came out in the 1987 and romcom not gettin together, not aged as well as it shoulda. it wasnt hot takin everything.

better version of this movie exist now.

i was just at tik tock with some poeple and we conversed about midwest vs east coast vs big cities. these are all people who we dont relate to cause they are in arrested development.

big city movie, prioritize their carreer, friedns with coworkers, people in big cities dont understand and arrest development and carreers and critics love it cause these characters exist in their world.

for us it doesnt really make sense in our life, coming from that angle the movie really does make sense coming from a midwestern perspective. feels vanilla. movie gets vanilla score - 3 screwdrivers from concentrate.",3
Matinee,Daniel,"I don’t have too much to add, I feel like joe dante really loved b-horror movies, with the humor and care went into Mant!

Wish he woulda given more into start off with family friendly, 1960s kinda vibe.

But then to turn on it and go satire at the end.

it didnt do that, i think it coulda gone into really good category. feel like a lot of you guys. right in th emiddle with my 3 shopping cart uncles.",3
Playtime,Daniel,"im happy you chose this movie cause I needed an excuse to choose this movie.

I watched two of this mivoes first one at the can can, this was a masterpiece so excited to see it.

Knew the financial baggage and agreed with what everyone had to say with slow pace dichotmized falling asleep and incredible restaurant scene.

i have to agree with people this is a masterpiece in its own right. no other movie visually doing this, but to give it a masterpiece for me it needs a narrative. in hindsight i have to give it a 4 crown brands as entry into recursive clubs.",4
Something Wild,Daniel,"ryan has seen the movie twice.

All of us have seen it once.

We talked a lot about this movie, has manic pixie dream girl problems. I don’t like that its called ""something wild"" but then show's black america in the background.

Feels weird viewed with that lense. take that away and i fucking loved this movie so much.

had the feelies in it. i loved the first half. just a hang.

fleeting moments of being wreckless. joy of not worry about it was captured and really really lubbed it.

if it landed on feet and he didnt get the girl and in his pattern shirt and pattern tie to kind of realize, but then it didnt do it so it just kinda... i still loved it so 4 virginias for lubber t-shirts.",4
Juwanna Mann,Daniel,"I was listen to the reviews even if muted.

I had to clean up theatre 2 after our 420 film.

I think I would echo a lot of people. The movie was a lot of fun to write down 1 liners, once it got it's sentimental ending its not gonna be as fun to talkabout. this very ridiculous conversation i was slightly participate in but mostly listen to the podcast.

made me realize this movie has unforgivable moments. i was gonna give it 2 but i think it feels like 1 cgi boob

jordan: or titty cup

suction cupped against a glass pane.",1
So I Married An Axe Murderer,Daniel,"
gotta get this movie outta my rear view. I really don’t like mike meyers at all. I think mike meyers is trash.

He does a good job at shrek. And austin powers.

I remember rachel was on her phone scrolling through the whole movie.

Can someone get mad with me about what is happening with mike meyers on screen.

this conversation has been really good. context of his whole situation.

i think there was a lot of fun aspects with the cop all the stuff we talked about.

even the female characters both were enjoyable. did not enjoy his beatnick performance.

have to give this 5 woman and -3 whoa man = 2 units.",2
Pretty Woman,Daniel,"
im gonna say this conversation has been really good. When this movie ended I really enjoyed my experience.

I was worried that I broadcast newsd it again, like decent movie but boring conversation.

I was nervous, picking a movie not good movie to talk about, but i really enjoye dour time this evening.

i think the biggest takeaway from this movie we allknow there's like  a 5 star movie in here the ingredients: storyline, premise, julia roberts. the bones are awaesome but it kinda fails probably because the company that produced it disney and year it was made.

end of day super breezy and super oddly enjoyable for how many problems it has.

world acknowledges problems and this movie needs a remake real bad.

take the premise and make pretty woman again it could be amazing.

thats my take rachel and i both liked this movie. loved lack of conflict. gonna give this a very very high 3 steaming polo divits.",3
Roman Holiday,Daniel,"keeps the train rollin

this my second audry hepburn movie shes sooo good in bfast with tiffany she capitvates you as you know in this movie.

Was excited happy we did it but we didn’t talk about it this movie is a frasier episode! 2 people lying and thinking they gettin by with it but both are lying and comedic but instead its beautifully sad like life.

this movie works cause the ending but because they arent together this beautiful moment in time and we can all relate to that so many iconic scenes lets smash guitars over peolpes heads, this coulda been near perfect if it wasnt greggy peckky but with 2022 lense we needy more authenticyt and too much hollywood he brungt.

4 truthy hands inside zombie --- monster --- gods mouth

jordan: hey! jesus was a zombie.",4
Romance and Cigarettes,Daniel,"at this point in this call its just like yeah echo a lot of fhwats been said, thank you ryan for making this movie, fact ive never heard of this movie is crazy.

The mixed feelings makes sense, but so many scenes that etched in my brain,

loved this movie and crazy swings. it had that 2005 masked and anonymous energy. we all graduated highschool around that time.

this is just a weird year for art and film. this movie captured that weird moment.

the movie ends on a bummer and also the sexual undertones like overt, there is a lot of it that is cool but then a lot of creepy shit. but then knowing john tutorro was woody allen friend but gross blast watching it.

gotta do hake hot take and give it a 3 cucumbers in gardners ass.",3
Secretary,Daniel,"okay.

Okay babyee.

Summed up what I was feeling. Basically if you combined sams review plus hakes interview, my headspace I was not really in the mood to watch anything on the longest day of the year and be inside. But its movie club, lets do it.

couldant get in vibe and i agree with hake rachel has a close friends and she wa slike what the fuck this has nothing to do with what the community is all about, does this movie get a pass or get some 2002 stuff or because its like shining a light on this group of people.

hake: there was also female reviewers and this is wild.

shaggy: is cause they shining light on this and thus doing it correctly. i had a lot of conflicting thoughts. the spanking and masturbation scene on her made me feel real bad and...

the movie came into did not like way came out i dont feel anything about this movie i dont feel good i dont feel bad, its just a movie. wish could give 2.5, but it's a 3. most positive review over here because i feel nothing.",3
The Rocketeer,Daniel,"you guys don’t understand.

Just roll with it.

You guys know my black hole that is superhero stuff, minus batman. Penny hardaway baby, basketball.

I didn’t know this was crazy the nazi thing broke my brain. It had that indiana jones vibe of that era. i did enjoy the twist like. OMG he would be a nazi.

get thrown that as an adult. at the beginning i was like... oh no, this movie gonna be a thing.

then alan arken tho, hes a gonna be a rea guy. happening good time.

grithif obserbatory. the mobs like okay you nazi? we agree on fbi, mob we hate the nazis!

that part was very very funny. will always make me laugh. that's one thing america can agree upon, nazis. they suck.

sorry guys in and out big event, down a director.

the one thing i think i took away from this conversation takeaway twist the story around you got a KILLER KILLER movie.

lets remake the movie/

lets get that llc.

BABY

maybe the animated series reworked the script.

live action little adults.

timothee chalamander as the rocketteer. flying slither boy.

The Perfect Host,Daniel,"thyme traveler.

Export something. I will not export the video now. Exporting the preshow.

That’s why I texted you guys. Canopy is a national thing connected to the libraries. It's just wheather your library is a party of it. You sign in going ""here's my name and here's my library"" and like yeah. review this movie.

second time, second movie club, we watched this movie. i remember the first half of the movie and the low budgetness of this movie and its goign for things. um. i forgot everything iwas going to say.

end of story concept of the movie is a good idea it was written so poorly directed and executed poorly. it's gut reaction of the film was in a good place. it didn't really land a couple of things coulda gone in more interesting places. i cant believe ive watched this movie twice like a lotta you guys.

movie i watch niles crane frasier bit convesation we were on a clip we would go off the rails and talk for a topic and go ten minutes its been not like the movie we avoid talkin bout actually movie the heart was in ag ood place so 2 cheeky lil mystery boxes. it tried .

Jordan: it tried really hard. added another idea,",2
Throw Momma From the Train,Daniel,"I have a comment to piggyback.

While watchin this movie, I was like oh yeah this is ryans pick. Ryans pick got a vibe.

Matinee. Romance and cigs. Misery.

Had a vibe. Wait, I don’t think ryan picked this one. Out of this movie I felt a ryan's movie from this and then we heard all that from ryan.

this movie was. obviously we had issues where it didnt go, it kept our attention the whole time.

like whats the next bit, next joke. had a big issue with the female character, just get rid of her as a person woulda worked. keep as coworker.

i think this ages well and our 2022 lense chips away at this too much, had we grown up with it we woulda loved it more, cant fault love 3 copies one for each toilet, and one other copy for the bedroom of 100 girls id like to pork.",3
Midnight Run,Daniel,"clears throat.

This is the first movie that I picked for movie club with a pure gut, saw this movie and don’t know anything bout it and just want to watch it.

The ironic part this has been some of the most fun ive had randomly throwing up a movie.

it was really fun for everything we said. maybe its talked about more, but i just didnt really know of it. charles grodin's performance is incredible.

one thing that was one of the funniest bits was the through line with mosely with deniro, just chasing him and the cat n mouse with the mob and fbi.

loved all of it. so close to a perfect movie, but it went on maybe 15 mins too long. it hits a peak in the desert, all the cop cars come along, and like shit theres 35 minutes left.

thats when the fbi stuff happens, and gets a bit long, so close to perfection, so close.

but holy shit, charles grodin the man, gotta go with 4 cause it smells perfection, 4 non-counterfeit counterfeit 20s!",4
Hard-Boiled,Daniel,"add that hyphen.

I was editing and pulling a reif and editing a video and listting and deep into masking out a hand it was super cool.

It was super cool just listening to you guys talk about this movie that you guys really really enjoyed watching.

this was awesome conversation about this movie i just watched.

i had zero expectations, no expectations. only jon woo movie i seen was mission impossible 2 faceofffaceofffaceoff thank you hake for laughing at my joke.

this movie came in super hot. i dont know what to think about it and it got more and more interesting with the plot and trying to keep up with it, it was a perfect movie club movie and i really enjoyed how ridiculous it was in the beginning to how level it got in the end and then crazy at the end barbell film im gonna think about this movie for a long time.

in movie club. history. this needs to be remembered. 5 day saving little pisspot movie. give it a 5.",5
Toys,Daniel,"
the pandemic we started this whole thing and we had to be special.

We are all so damn extroverted and movie night is a good time and those my thoughts on hakes review good.

We all said it and I think there was a fantastic, great movie that coulda been made with these bones.

the bones of this movie were really good and i think we all really noticed that. the problem is that it got in the wrong hands.

this movie feels like it was crafted around bits, like robin williams hands, and this concept. that's where all the sex scenes come in. this scene's funny right? let's just make it work.

like the jamie fox thing with the bra.

that's an snl thing, that's  the movie suffered from some attention grabbing thing sadly that 90 minute movie was 2 hours and everything extra was added onto it.

But

there's some performances in my brain, not mad that it's here.

ll cooljay for the win, this only gets 2 peas and carrots in a problematic white puke pile.",2
The Last Emporer,Daniel,"I am excited that we cracked open the first epic movie. And it was a big one for that.

I think the conversation was good because of the historical context you guys gave, happy you guys gave it was a little slog, loved music loved the costumes.

back half, not sure if pacing was off, cause of the mixed bag for me we gonna go with 3 turds in tha bowl.",3
Strange Brew,Daniel,"sadly didn’t get to participate too much.

Sad I missed this because it was a fun ride. My brain had no awareness of this movie. I also was not aware of Rick Moraniss's heavy canadian background.

I watched this with Rachel, we were talking aftewards. It's like wayans world meets billy teds and take out beer and put in canada and you gotta movie.

I also think I really enjoyed watching a movie about dudes who loved beer so much. Like this won't ever be doen again. Two dudes obsessed with beer and drinking so much is awesome.

People who like drinking, people aren't going to find that funny anymore. It was kind of fun - like mainstream - these' guys drink beer and it's funny.

so yeah forgot a lot about the movie, but I think what I do remember I really had a lot of fun and so much fun they had with it.

Thanks Hake I will never forget hearing the story that you were watching this in a camper van so 3 x 2 minute pisses on the loony bin.",3
Equilibrium,Daniel,"I will hop in.

I don’t have anythig smart to say about the movie at all.

Hake I had the same experience. When we first jumped in I was like oooh nooo.

Then we started getting into the story, and it was kinda entertaining.

At the end of the day we wanted it to be better, but the time period its a simple movie cause that time period.

that era was not very complicated with how we thought about things in art, at least in these corners of the world.

yeah i think we said everything. i dont have anything smart to say.

but holy shit taye diggsss face is the best thing to movie club in a while, this is two mr diggs's faces on a marble floor for myself.",2
The Natural,Daniel,"hes got his baseball bat.

Wonderboy

baseball is probably one of the most cinematic sports, that’s probably why I love it

it has pace, storylines naturally happen during the game. Theres a lot of individual battles with batters.

This movie has always been on the watch list.

i think i talked about jordan off to the side.

i hope they do the sports side of it well at least the drama was enjoyable when they did have it.

and yes, it was majical realism with homeruns all the time.

issues i had with plotholes and it being a novel makes a ton of sense.

i was gonna say um, could not get over robert redfords age. can we cast someone looks closer to age?

but i really enoyed that and some of the secenes are gonna be in my brain. would love to see a cut where he strikes out and they do it like the book 4 poison little morsel tartlets.",4
Little Shop of Horrors,Daniel,"
happy we watched this movie cause I havent seen this version.

I told rachel, its ryans pick, he doesn’t know what he's thinking yet, and I was like, ""I bet hes gonna pick little shop of horrors"" and she was like ""no hes not gonna"".

I knew he wasnt gonna pick batman returns.

and he picked it and i was like, i knew it.

i did not know what fully i was getting into it. it was a hard musical straight up.

this conversation was great.

i was trying to figure out reading between the lines i was thinking it was a critique on selling your soul / capitalizm. anything you gonna put your soul into was gonna destroy you if you let it get too far,

but yeah had a lot of fun and... yeah. we said all the good things.

so this is gonna be 4 glitter lilly funeral arrangements. 1 more than the movie itself.",4
Uncle Buck,Daniel,"lets rock n roll.

I was blown away that like with johnson that noone else has really seen this or had a history of it.

I knew I had like blindspots in these john hughs movies, and this one made sense the minute it started.

They were cursin or whatever my parents would be like nah.

rachel was like oh this is a classic.

it felt like a holiday. movie. yes this is a christmas movie.

this was definnitely a christmas movie.

i enjoyed the writing of the film so much minus the nuances that we expect with our lense which is uncle buck's arc and niece tias arc.

that woulda kicked it in the upper echelon of movies.

the two little kids.

i wish we coulda hang out with this whole damn movie.

yeah. everything else we talked baout it and this classic is now in my brain.

to bring back death.

john hughs died at 59 walking in the street in new york on a trip, got a heart attack.

take care of yourself guys.

wasnt even in chicago.

is john hughes even still alive?

died in 2009.

anyways.

4 gnat circumcising hatchets!",4
Office Space,Daniel,"office space came to me very late in sentimental season.

Its poetic now that I have a cubical and work for an ad agency.

I love the world that office environment creates.

This movie, once he goes into hypnosis, theres a big critique in capitalism / socialism - goes full socialist in paying bills and live my life of boringness and dress in all grey which is what people thinkg socialiism is.

i think this movie held up minus the gay slang that was still around.

other than that im pumped to watch and relive this movie with you and im suprised on how much this movie made in my life, 5 bobs on how much this movie affected me. 5 bobs this movie affected me. all five of them love michael bolton.",5
The Karate Kid,Daniel,"*hops in*

I thought this was a very interesting pick. I think a lot of us went older in our scope.

I was going to go more adult sentimental, sounds like jordan did in the opposite but I love.

Adulthood of his twenties.

I was excited to watch this. i think theres a really killer film in here. you cut the beginning a lil bit, and get more into the action and the relationship.

re-make, hollywood movie, china. all that and they got a super great movie with a lot of heart and all the stuff we love about it.

and this is super poetic to end the 99th movie on this, and we started with bloodsport all those years ago, and then we got this from bloodsport to karate kid.

before we all break and come back.

gotta give this one 3 jackets up with attitude.",3
Jupiter Ascending (re-view),Daniel,"*background chatter about steamy hot loads*

mila kunis says ""she knew her 2015 jupiter ascending would flop at the box office before it started"" the luckiest girl alive actress spoke to blah blah blah blah blah quote: ""when did we know the movie would flop? when production got sliced in half"" often times these things have a very good stry line but extraordinary other things. budget got cut and movie was different.

this movie coulda been a 5 but instead it was a ONE.",1
Dhoom,Daniel,"yeah. I like uh most of you guys have not ventured into Bollywood, even though I know what you are getting into with bollywood. This is super hard to judge from this movie club dubble.

We are coming at it with our movie club lense. And that man, man last music scene next 10 seconds, next 10 seconds... there was no storyline advancement.

It was just we are doing a music video. You would erase the music videos and get the same thing. but i gess thats not the point of Bollywood.

Also did you have a hard time keeping up with the subtitles? This one was you were forced to stick with the whole thing, which is something we did not talk about.

I think this conversation was a blast and i agree with Jordan I was like, Johnson where is the google algorithm AI movies you are picking but yeah.

As a person who has had to screen indy films for film fest. This felt (i know 2004) this felt like something i would have watched from last year's film fest made for $10k.

Mindblowing that this camera work was accepted. Fun to watch in this context.

2 removed glasses. DHOOM. *every says dhooom*",2
Inu-Oh,Daniel,"I picked this movie for movie club because I didn’t wanted to watch it alone.

Movie club is becoming movies I want to watch and dissect with your friends.

This made me realize why I picked for movie club.

I had higher expectations on certain elements story wise, and thats what i expected from night is short, and loved that vibe.

not exactly what i wanted from a glam rock opera, but i liked it a bit more after talkin about it more.

because of the source this makes sense that someone who doesnt identify as their birth gender, this movie easily could be picked up as that because i think the undertones are there. orientation, gender identity.

its a transformation story, and i think that its great.

i love how the director gets you in the weeds with japanse culter. you are so deep in the weeds with fuedal japan like what is going on.

and um, im stuck between a 4 and a 3. truly i slept through the whole thng. i wonder if its gonna age, 3 from my experience i think the songs were a little long and felt 1 note when it was a queen pardoy. positve 3 cursed elongated arms.",3
Super Mario Bros.,Daniel,"Ive always known that this movie existed because I never watched it because it looked so ridiculous.

Super mario world is easily my favorite game of all time. Probably the only game that im actually good at.

So I had a lot of exciting and patience going in knowing the lore and yeah everything, you guys are correct what we talked about.

but, once we got on board with not caring about anything i think i had a pretty good time, and overall i enjoyed this movie more than i did not enjoy this movie so this this 3 screamin martini worms!",3
We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story,Daniel,"dude the names in this movie were insane.

We already talked about it.

Never heard of this movie, which is wild. I shoulda known about this going to blockbuster, or checking out at scotts and kroger in fort wayne, id be like mom can we get a movie.

it was always like rodney dangerfield or brave little toaster.

i cant believe this did not pop up on our radar.

this is wild.

it was the same vibe and watching this as an adult makes me want to rewatch all those movies.

the premise is insane:

wish radio
kids dinosuars
done!

noone proofed this?

noone was like, lets make this a little more interesting.

i dunno.

the internet wasnt really fully formed yet.

theres a part of this movie that is very valuable because of that. cant beat it up too much for the insane plot.

at the end of the day i couldnt figure out the vibe of this i couldnt fully sink my teeth into it, so im fully happy that i watch it. if you gonna give me 1 song out of the middle of nowhere feels a little pandering.

so... i agree with everything jordan said, but i am gonna give it 2 circuses with a notion of spice.

",2
Blood Simple,Daniel,"I've seen this movie. Coming off of fargo ive seen this movie before I was excited to watch it. I was not in a good headspace during pandemic but then by making me know not love this movie I had the same issues everyone had with it and went in with low expectations.

i think this movie requires your attention to bring back some of the conversation we had. I do love boring movies.

i like watching slow boring shit sometimes.

all the things hit. the bullets. the fans. all that kinda made sense.

at the end of the day, this is just an episode of frazier and noone knows how to talk to each other, and i think thats why i loved it. everything hit this time.

that top song at the end, i really love it and love seeing the roots where it came from 4 curtainless windows or hot glasses of milk that's been sitten there for 2 days.

jordan: thats not the fuckin measurement.",4
Gattaca,Daniel,"after hakes whiplash… broke this up into two nights, was excited to return to it.

Didn’t even know about the movie. Love ethan hawke. Always a pleasure.

I brought it up lightly, a lot of our critiques are very valid, but a lot of them are as if this movie was made now.

whcih is very true movies dive into the right areas. at the same time this movie is super simple and its beautiful because of it's simplicity.

it was super refershing to see it be simple. you know we gonna bring up these topics but not explore them.

same thing im going to remember this very positively when i talk about it and the world. even thogh the movie is racist and white, that's just 90s problems.

i gotta lean positive, so this gets 4 chickenshits unmichaelphelps like swimmer boys.",4
Every Which Way But Loose,Daniel," comingoff of gattaca sci fi I was like oh god thank god we don’t like making movies like this where they can just phone it in and its just funny cause its clint eastwood.

It was such a weird two er double edged sword. It was a hangout movie, which I liked that hanging out and floatin along.

so much casual violence and there just no conflict. i like no conflict if it has a purpose.

i dug the hangout in the honkey tonk bars in 70s La. I agree we should have clint eastwood someone else then we woulda been rollin.

really frustrated by it but we talked about all that. now that we are reviewing. i think i am going to regard the ending of the movie and the emotional craziness and he went on this chase and had to go back.

i wish they would have, with the boxing thing, i wish there was a payoff, there was a good movie in here happy in my brain, 3 pissens spittens fartins and ass pickenz.",3

The Big Chill,Kevin,"I felt cheated at the end of the movie. Maybe that's the point but I don’t feel like the movie delivers that successfully. The jokes are great. I enjoyed spending time with these people but its almost like they don’t care about their dead friend at all. so well made, got sucked along from moment to moment. It goes down easy. I know my parents have recommended. Come up empy handed. 2 dead kevin costners - 2.5 at most

As im watching it I was like okay this is not the typical john wayne movie, which is interesting. I laughed my ass off at this movie. i was charmed by it. like i was in the story. i thought the relationship dynamic between john wayne (while troublesome, i wont defend the sexual politics) i thought itw as interesting for the era, characters more nuanced maureen ohara i was in love with her the whole movie, my favorite john wayne performance. looks at wrecked bed - homeric. lol. 5 spiked cigarettes!",5

But.

w/ sean connery passing I felt very compelled to do this one. There is just nuttiness and campiness in this one and it is crazy. as far as shitty bonds go, and i think sam hit the nail, it is farily borning.

Django,Kevin,"ready?

DJANGO

um. Yeah. I dunno, I I mean. I only picked this movie because I was forced to 1966. It was a weird year. A lot of art house not right for movie club.

Django came out same year as the good the bad and the ungly. You can see how this one gets overshadowed. its riding on the coattails of that.

its a recylced plot that doesnt necessary succeed. the violence comes out the ears get cutoff the hands get smashed the theme song rips.

the last like. what 10 minutes of the movie was like what the fuck is gonna happen. i thought the movie was over. Like jacksons gonna kill the mexicans and the racists wins and oh lets see this shit.

then you have the scene at the graveyard and its badass and the themesong kicks in and the fucking put the machine gun in coffin and took it out and filled it with gold so i gotta give it 4 of those for doin that.",4
Metropolis,Kevin,"this movie pretty cool, lot of cool things to look at.

This was one by the time it was finishing up. I kind of would like to watch this on the big screen. This movie does scale soooo well.

For all of its flaws, if I had seen this on A big screen i would have been like HOLY SHIT its flawed but its fucking amazing.

that first scene where the camera zooms out of the ziggurat and the zepplins and the title card.

fuck rock. fuck rock forever. rock is a fucker he should have died within 30 minutes of this movie.

It was scary and it scared me and I was afraid that these martian aliens were going to come lazer me in my bed.

ever since then i have watched it and it was stuipd and it was fun.

shags new take blew my mind open and i also agree with everything jordan said.

i wish it was a tigher package. i wish we got more time with the martians fuckin with the planet, but yeah, we didnt. we got what we got so i give it 4 attacks by mars.",4
WR: Mysteries of the Organism,Kevin,"Hesitates

Monkey Bone,Kevin,"*eats pizza*

I wanna start off by saying ""damn you guys really like this movie""

I wasn’t expeciting that. I was very grossed out the entire movie. From the get go, there was a part of me that I wanted to revisit this and I remember this movie being bizzare more than anything and only vaguely remember chris katan being rediculous and my kid brain loved it.

brendan frazier let me down, not good in this movie.

but it was wild, as gross as it was, theres plenty to look at theres a lot goign on here. holy shit that chris katan scene just thank fucking god it exists.

yeah.

im on the shag end. the chris katan elevates it from very gross to just okay bad gross to organs gorwing out of chris katan.",2

DRUK (Another Round),Kevin,"ill go next.

Going off wat jordan said this is an interesting one sam spoke to it oo not just jordan, we all been talking about it.

I thought it straddled the line really well and it kinda walked that like, uh characters are responsible for themselves, its not the alchoohls fault it lead to the how the users leads to its onw concequences sort of thing,

Not knowing anything about this movie, I thought it was weirdly charming for a lo-fi indy movie and I like… I was just happy that there are a bunch of not pretty looking actors in here, it just made it all the more enjoyable to watch. dean imperial for the win cast him in more movies i hope to see him in shitty cop roles for the next 20 years in all my hollywood action movies or burnt out mob dads or suburban dad with teenage daughter and doesnt want to go to prom with the weird art kids 3 exceptionally out of place pillow fights.",3
The Skin I Live In,Kevin,"this is the
third time I saw this movie. I was excited to watch it first as I said at the top.

I dunno it was an interesting view and I remember watchign this movie at 22 and feeling like my mind was blown and you are in highschool and you just started seeing movies its arthouse and critically acclaimed like whoa this made me think so much and watching it this time its like oh yeah... this is an interesting idea that kinda just skims the surface and touches a lot of taboo subjects.

and it creates a reaction out of everyone but i feel like the movie doesnt necessarily have anything that its really trying to say on a deeper lever. but... the craft is there, i still loved it i think a lot of the humor, other than the tiger scene, crackles.

Sorcerer,Kevin,"let me review this shit and then we can free form talk.

Yeah so, I heard of sorcerer. It gets tossed around a lot on movies subreddit. Its got this like… I has an aura around it it because its considered a lost hollywood film from its time. always been a lot of chatter around it. ive been interested in seeing.

when i saw the wages of fear and realized sorcerer was  remake iw as like cool, even cooler. i was very excited to watch this movie.

i really admire freidkin's apprach in his movies to just - when the dude directs action and intention - hes on ahis own level theres something about ti on my the edge of seat this movie fucking rules (excorcist) french connection has the car chase you know the dude knows what hes doing with action.

this movie was lacking in a lot of ways. had i not seen the orginal i would feel differently about it but like there was something lacking in just the psychological tension. i did not care about the characters at all. the characters are just a literal another vehicle, different vehicle than actual characters watching while crossing a bridge and shit.

the cars are main character. hats are secondary character. humans are tertiary tier and that said 70 movies rule 3 drips of nitroglycerine.",3
Shogun Assassin,Kevin,"funny shag brought up sorcerer, cause the firs ttime I watched this which was not the first time I watched this that was years ago, but first time I watched this week it was like man this is weird a remake I havent seen the orginal. im on its edge im on its mind.

i looked into it i read a little about it the soundrack is updatd the fvoiceover is all new too the movie. when i watche dit while trippin like it cemented in my brain im watching lone wolf n cub, what im watchign is shogunassasssin and its its own fuckin thing and a man and his sun trying to fight every trap and hes got sound design on his side. hes got voiceover on his side. hes got the sound of voiceover on his side.

i gotta watch lone wolf n cub its not shogun assassin and when you ask me about lone wolf n cub i will show you shogun assissin because:

What can I say, sylvester stallone is a great guy in this movie. Beaug brandenburg hes a nice guy

kit pardue is a super nice guy and I wish him all the rest. Bernenberg

sam shut up

it’s a movie about three nice guys being friends an dbeing forced to race against each other. it sucks and is terrible and the scene in chicago is truly a highlight.

great fucking garbage ass movie worth 1 distrstessed denim cowboy hat",1
Exit Wounds,Kevin,"agree with jordan. *is eager*

this movie was dumb. Uh like jordan this was the third steven segall movie I saw.

I unlocked the very first segall movie I ever saw as a kid, the 1 pg-13 segall movie with jarule called ""half past dead"".

so that was fun to unlock that in my brain.

otherwise, uh, yeah this movie man, at least the first 45 minutes, the vp thing was fun, after that the movie was like what are we doing here. and then shit started popping off and fuckin great.

only reason why i was actually engaged in this movie was to hear the phrase exit wounds uttered.

and it never. happened.

theres like 2 second left in th emove, segall walkin away isiah washington, how they gonna fit it in. didnt

Pink Flamingoes,Kevin,"uhhh okay.

Iee. Just. Off the get go. I had no idea what - the fuck we were gonna get into with this movie.

The tought occurred to me ""oh yeah I bet a john waters movie would be fun, hes sposed to be trashy and interesting""

I forgot what i was even signing this group for. i forgot that devine eats dogshit, and then i was like... oh yes! this is that.

and that was you know, after all the other insane shit.

shag's text, like i dont know if you guys had watched the movie before that point. i wa slike.. oooh no what are we getting into.

the first half. its rough. its a bad movie its pooryly made, poorly acted, and some of the shit that was just going on it was givin me the heeby jeebys.

but then all of the sudden it was like goign trhough a wall, the movie kciked into overdrive for me and i twas like. this is some of the funniest shit ive ever seen in a while.

i couldnt. i remember going to the theatre seeing jackass 2. i would love to see this in theatres with a bunch of unsuspecting people just not knowing what the fuck was going to happen on screen.

after it was over i wanted to watch th ebonuses and i was purely in a awe after this movie. i gotta give it 4 ragign buttholes.",4
Three The Hard Way,Kevin,"yeah. Put me in the camp of shag and sam, this week has been fuckin crazy since I took on the new gig.

Trying to watch this movie, like oh no I gotta squeeze this one in today I was sooo happy to be watching this movie.

Also like... when johnson picked this movie i was like i have no idea what this movie is. ive never heard of it th eonly two movies where the title rings a bell: lapsis and medium raw.

um. so not knowing what iw as getting ingto with this .... dude johnson. thank you. thank you for picking this movie.

i was like dude. this movie slept on.

yeah its got problems its clunky but damn. i stumbled on a lost gem. i was in it. it brought joy to my day to where my body was physically dude you gotta take anap and finish before the call tonight.

talkin bout it with you guys yeah this movie just made me happy and all the other movies i give this rating all i can say i felt full on like dumb. elation. watcion thinm i gotta gib it 5 of dem patriotic patriotic topless biker tortureres",5
Mallrats,Kevin,"bounces off reif.

Shag if you want a one sentence review, don’t fuckin call me out. This aint happen.

No. I. I. I feel for a little bit of what reif was saying enve though I have more history with this movie.

I literally thoguht it was the funniest shit ive ever seen. mallrats sat as comedy movie pantheon in my head.

as i was watching it yesterday, something about it was a  little sour, but we talked a lot about that and what it really came down to the way brody and TS came off throughout.

i dont like them as the heros of this movie. or at least there wasnt... jeremy london is not convincing as a character that TS is supposed to be.

a way more competent and likeable actor would have been able to pull of that final dating showgame but all that said...

i gotta agree with sam and shag that this movie is fun. its fun its a lot of fun and the comedy works in a lot of places even if its not funny.

but really this movie is the stepping stone to jay and silent bob strike back.

that movie i feel very confident that it would be fuckin hilarious. mallrat had the same energy but not there.

history i wanted to look unkind on it but the conversation pulled the cat and gerbil out of my ass and i gotta give it 3 chocolate coverated stink palmbs",3
Ishtar,Kevin,"*jordan sings*

so maybe uh. Ill put the thesis at the top of this one.

I think the conversation was better than the movie, but also it got me thinking about th emovie again and theres a lot about this movie that is really funny… but there is a lot wrong with it.

we discussed that.

dustin hoffman, warren batey, get them outta here.

something about the script, it was such a weird and wild watch, it was the frist time when i recognized like:

oh the script is good and the actors are just working for the matierla.

i just think this is a movie that was 5 to 10 years after its time.

um. which isnt necessarily a bad thing but it. uh you sorta see why a movie like this is a misfire in the 80s.

uh i understand the cult appeal around it now. and im not fully on board with it yet, but if you threw this on at a party i would be cacklin my ass off in certain parts.

rogers and clarke you guys aint 1 and don ein my eyes and i think you got another hit on yuh 2 rogers and clarke hit recerds.

I fucking hated this.

Nah dude zero cyclo genosiderz see evidence battlefield earth the year 3000

I don’t know what it is, I had fun, I was able to see connections between this and medium raw, the only thing that truly deserves a zero?

so yeah, it needed a friend. i konw i gave masked and anonymous a zero but that one i regret. so my score now this season i got to run the gamet accidentally.

daniel: he hit the cyclo. whoa hake, im proud of you

Same: fuckin contrived. fake bullshit right there

Hake: naw dude, i hated this movie.

ALRIGHT. i changed my mind. 0.0 cyclo.",0
Waiting to Exhale,Kevin,"so yeah like johnson I started this movie and got really critical, not for what johnson was critical of but more like forresst witacker not knowing what the fuck to do with the camera

then I settled in and once that secene between wesley snipes and angela basset like here we go i dunno shit like really solidified for me like i felt like the charm of the movie reeealy really came alive.

started taking the dynamics of all the relationships more seriously, the movie stopped waiting to exhale. lol.

Mamma Mia,Kevin,"um

I so I mostly agree with everything been said before.

I went back to the question I posed earlier about the theme, whats it about in summation and my review.
Actual Hake (not the previous one): I will say my body and spirit were prepared for this movie. A part of me was always curious of Mamma Mia and I was fully ready to acept the dumb spirit of this movie. This movie is candy. But what I will say, this movie melted my stone cold cynical heart, but ABBA is infectious and the cast is incredible, but most of the cast and ABBA don't mix. I was disappointed in the set pieces as a movie musical it just didn't pop. I was bored and my brain was wanting to have fun but I wanted to zip through a musical number to get to fun but I'm glad I saw it. I'm glad I got to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist of Mamma Mia. I'll see the segual. Gotta see what Cher does. I'm with my boy Jordan, 2 TBDs.

Brilliantovaya ruka,Kevin,"*bounces off that*

earlier in the day I was talking to sam about foreign films that I have seen. They all have this air or prestige about it, you are getting like… something that feels important.

*air quotes* artistic

so it was really fun to sort of watch a movie that really felt, almost designed in a way that a hollywood studio would be but for Russian audiences.

caveat, it comes with maybe propoganda or anything that in there.

but i was really suprised by the idea of the movie was so much fun. anything with smugglers, i thought the really first have was sort of like just had like a wilder energy.

the slipping on the melon joke as the codeword i thought was brilliant.

yeah so it sort of just like became like almost like a sketch after sketch yeah we like just go through adventures with diamond arm but gonna fail.

for most part it was enjoyable. really really fun look at a think like one country's side of movie making that other than Andre Tarkofsky, i know nothing about Russian cinema. i really enjoyed this movie i give it 3 robes with fuck i forgot the buttons.

shaggy: ""clams""

kevin: ""pearls""",3
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,Kevin,"Soo ya know having ventured into a lot of batmans stuff as of recent or superhero stuff generally, um, this was a really nice reminder of what s great about batman and dc animztion and some superhero stories I really love. That they go for the emotional throat of this. Bruce's backstory is awesome. Its effective. It makes the twist work. For a kids movie its pretty dark and adult in some suprising ways. Sitting down for 76 minutes and I felt like I was sold an appitizer and got a whole meal so 4 batarangs.

Victor/Victoria,Kevin,"*hake shows pubes*

came up on my list, lets do it, wanna see this.

we sat down last night, we were starting a bit late, shit we got 2 hours 15 minutes.

movie moves, gots that 60s spirit i love, the way the larger comedic set pieces and large club/restaurant eruptions, waiter comes back in the club right before the improvised dance.

on the scene where the one dance and 4 guys, two of the faceing front and back with the masks holy shit that sequence was phenomenal.

last half hour was last half hour. nuff said. its a bummer.

so. 4 normas small rages.",3
Drop Dead Gorgeous,Kevin,"duuuude yeah.

This. This isa movie that ive known about for a while as I was a kid. Always wanna see since its been recommended to me a lot so I was pretty just like if not excited I wa slike alright lets check this movie off, off the list.

I had a really conflicting interesting time with it. this conversaction really puts this movie in a higher esteem thatn i had with i was watching it.

just because tonally it threw me all over th eplace. the punching down was a problem. even for the time period.

um, from just the like, i mean, at the forefront of everything which we talked about which is ableist and some of the asian american family, straight up i dont know where they necessarily are punching down. i feel like they are punching down on rural america without the heart. but the actors lit that up and that's amazing. i love brittany murphy. lots of characters that really work.

dark tonal shifts with people who blown up in trailer like whoa she survived? felt really herky jerky with this.

murder mystery didntw ork even though beauty pageot worked on skits together.

structurally i was just bored confused it took me out of th emovie a lot and lots of humur i really missed i gotta go with initial i do tend to rate these things on initial phases of what i watched this movies from, she might have only gotten 1 beer cans saudeed to her hands but i gotta give it 2 beer can hands.",2
The American Astronaut,Kevin,"*wakes up from nap*

did you try to use the alarm system? What did your father teach you?

*universal lols*

my father taught me that this movie is pretty tight pretty weird and I had fun with it I liked the cinematography and last shot blew me away and i was like jesus christ did i get tricked into watching a 1920s silent movie? 3 cig.",3
Bones,Kevin,"im at the midwaypoint of the reviews and so far I think that the uh consenus, maybe not everyone agrees with me, and im with this consensus.

There seems to be some good bones to this movie. [jordan: but bad blood]

good bones, but bad blood.

The blood's a wash for me. had no idea goin into it. i was hoping snoop dogg was going to be a pimp in this movie, [shag: or in it]

i like it, sucked in the beginning. middle third oh we gotta interesting movie on our hands, final third i checked out even tho shit happened.

2 spooky maggot rain-houses",2
Zombi 2 (Zombie Flesh-Eaters),Kevin,"lets move past Zombie. Sharing some of your sentiments, ryan and sam. I was checked out the third act of this movie which I was kinda excited for, this movie was violent nothing crazy gorey.

Half way point and zombies battle shark? This is gonna get crazy. then it was in slow motion the third act.

up until the nurse got killed and the reusing footage of molotov cocktail i was pretty disappointed in int. soundrack isa  5 but yea this movie overall 2 tits out scuba divers.",2
Tales From the Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood,Kevin,"like sam I remember this movie being on comedy central, but I did not see as much of the movie as he did.

Only thing I remember was tounge down the throat punchin out the heart. So yeah, I was pumped to finally get to watch this movie, see some tales of the crypt.

the crypt keeper lived up to all of my expectations of what i wanted to see. i wish it had less wet blanket human being dennis miller.

2 skin expresses down to tuna tow. did i get that right?",2
Possession,Kevin,"so like one of my favorite sayings in all movies is hunt for the wilderpeeple where sam niel does almost nothing the entire movie but he's really funny.

Then you watch possession where he is a younger man and he's like really fun.

This movies crazy um, 4 trashcan feathers.",4
Misery,Kevin,"this movie lulled me in a way that like, theres a certain like, theres a charm to it. When I started it, theres. Theres almost like a TV movie feel to it?

Just how it starts, how he's getting taking care of, the sheen on the cinemtography and wholesome nature of the town,. there's a lot of this movie that feels so wholesome.

your aunt, never seen a movie before, you want to entertain her, so you are like ""yeah lets watch misery!""

so theres no cursing or violence in the first 50 minutes, but then at the end you have to find out what happens no matter what. um. yeah  idunno i love this movie.

Someone's Watching Me!,Kevin,"meet my delights to twist your tounges.

I was kinda like I dunno lukewarm about watching this movie.

I was not excited about john carpenters made for tv movie.

I just watched one.

O fuck that’s right tales for the crypt.

Hbo movie. Its not tv its hbo. network tv especially carpenter knowing its in the 70sbefore he got famous i was worried going in.

i twist had a lot of fun watchin this movie. more fun then i ever thought i would

constraints interesting totally break through even the music was missing still channeld it with his camera i loved and creeped out for all of it.

laura hutton was fantastic. yeah just had a blast with this movie.

Phantom of the Paradise,Kevin,"when shag picked this movi ewas pretty excied for it and I watched it last night in kinda a like half catatonic state I gotta get this movie in im excited I didn’t know what was going on I felt like I couldn’t keep up with I t in the way I wanted to but i was.

i dunno. this like i will stand by what i said earlier in this coversation like thank the movie club gods for this movie, i like shag have seen a shitton of depalmas movies, there's something about him where it kinda doesnt matter what the subject matter or theme of the movie is, i have watched ever depalma movie i have seen even his shittiest movies i have been somewhat enteratined by.

his filmmaking is on some crazy mastermind wavelength like in a hollywood way i just wanna see what his next fram is gonna look like even if it doesnt pay off in the end and this one exists on a weird different plane and level instead of his hitchcock ripoff films even with the hitchcock ripoff like the plunger to the face was great

all the movie is super great and super problematic and it bothers me but it doesnt i had a blast of a time 5 beef.",5
The Lady From Shanghai,Kevin,"oooooh.

Gonna start this off rel quik by sayin shag, 'fuck you tryin to do, fault in ofself and discussion other night, yer just wrong, citizen kane great movie'

this movie… not a great movie.

But I love it. After I went down the orsen wellse pipeline, it has lots of love and lore for ow fans, first time is aw i was tained but fused from esteem it had.

i feel like a lot of the steam comes from how unique it sits in the greater i think mostly in the noir category.

it isnt a noir movie but it adheres to the staples we see in the genre. this movie continues to sit in my head.

like a lot of times.

in the last 2 years i havent seen the movie... grisbees sweaty face sits there like ""how boutcha murder mee for $5,000""

i wanted to put his sweaty face in your heads. glad you liked it.

i give it from the hall of meers standport grisby showin up in the 3 mirrors of excitable sweaty grisbeez.",3
Naked Lunch,Kevin,"gogogogogogogo.

Love cronenburg and was excited for this pick. Don’t like, im indifferent about burroughs and beatnik.

Specially knowing grody and gross interesting in the 90s but the sheen of that interestingness has worn off as we move further way from it

i did like a lot of this movie and what croneburg was tryin to do .

had hard time following it and had no idea what peter weller was ssaying

the bugs were cool

i liked the spyness of interzone and agent things.

what it all mean? uh yeah i dunno what going on. cept william tell act killing his lover twice.

maybe he is saying burroughs needs to dig deep at clearly the wound which is him william telling his wife in the first place

if someone threw this movie on and i would sit down adn watchit again cause really interesting but the first time slipp through my fingers so 3 sips of mugwump jhism.",3
Go,Kevin,"
lets do this

I had seen this movie. I saw it in colleg and pretty sure sam mentioned it a bunch. Member this movie ""go"" then he quoted the n-word line.

I was like yeah watched this movie ""go"" so I watched it in college and it stuck with me.

At least when sam picked it i wa slike ""oh yeah okay i remember the chopped up format with multiple stories kinda revolving around 1 thing""

was disappointed in the way it didnt actually revolve around 1 thing.

after sara coranna gets hit with the car, im like here we go the titular movie.

then its like naw im gonna do this other thing over here, cliffhanger fun over.

i had a lot of fun watching the movie and it had really great energy going for it, as dumb as las vegas story is, theres lotsa fun shit inner.

frustrating way movie tease you up with multiperspectivea round 1 event setup, it doesnt do that which is rellyfrustating to me.

feels like a shrug when it coulda been a grub

all these parties connecting on one thing.

thats the big knock i gotta give so 3 awefuck i forgot the rating.

Riders of Justice,Kevin,"
I had a lot of fun watching this movie.

I watched it in two parts. First part yesterday. I was really enjoying it. Love setup and everyhing where it was going.

Character dynamics. Dynamic of group. Computer nerds pulling miliatry guy and use him to be ilike "" no basic setup of movie""

whole back half has sombre tone that is most interesting payoff you are here for awesome action revenge and im just still digesting that.

i finnish this movie on high net but conversation send me to reality and like i dunno kinda cooled me on the moovie so yeah i like finishing it i was a 4 im after conversation im a 3 chubby salamis.",3
Broadcast News,Kevin,"you ready?

Yes yes I am.

My review is jordans last line of his review.

Its everybody jee golly theyre swell but they heckin cuss, but I did like it a little more than jordan did.

Yeah, I agree with a lot of jordans sentiments, I really enjoyed the conversation more than i did the movie.

but i liked the time capsule of the movie. its a type of movie that i just dont voluntarily watch anymore

this whole... i dunno. james l brooks feels weird to call a totally vanilla movie a ""vibe"" man, but it is, in its own weird and straightforward way. um yeah. dunno. 3 orangejuice concentrated screwdrivers.",3
Matinee,Kevin,"the beets of the doug episode, you got it perfect my dude. Really nice job my friend. We are so great together.

Killer tofu, eieie. I cant tell you how much it’s the episode where he thinks hes a rockstar getting interviewed by the dream sequence in the girl school and its like... how you come up with those songs and looks at a plunger and is like - the plunger!

ill go next.

i like this movie. had a lot of fun stuff. and a lot of things that ill remember forever. and yeah it was mostly fine.

i think the tried to do too many styles at once maybe, wished it woulda committed in some different darker ways than the movie tried to do so 3 shopping cart uncles.",3
Playtime,Kevin,"this was not my first time watching this movie. I had seen it before. And yeah.

I was very excited to rewatch this, and I will say I was also very exhausted watching it last night, I feel like I was being assaulted by the movie.

Very much into the first half but by the time the restaurant came around i was like ""this hurts to watch""

wasnt that pleasant viewing this time around. but i love this movie, as a remnant of it's time and what it's doing its so much fun and funny.

like i said, the weird cold utilitarianness of it is offputting as it is and very funny to me and highly orchestrated.

by the time it gets to the nightclub it's descended into pure chaos..

first time watching i was high as fuck, i felt like i was watching someone make Samsara into a highly stylized play and still feel that way.

jordan: well done.",5
Something Wild,Kevin,"first time watch for me. But I definitely leaned on the side of enjoying the ride despite all the like… flaws I was sort of seeing with the movie. You know, using black america as texture even if it worked in some instances a lot of it was hmm this didnt age well.

yeah i was kinda just like... along for the ride. then when shit got really wild in th ebackhalf i was like man, he is like i thought the direction was amazing.

kinda walked an interesting tightrope, i just really enjoyed it so i agree with whateverbody has said as far as the lauding it and criticize it but yeah i enjoyed the watch so 4 virginia is for lubbers t-shirts.",4
Juwanna Mann,Kevin,"ill go next.

I watched the movie juwanaa mann whenever it came out on dvd, im pretty sure I laughed.

I watched it last night and I wa slike, ya now, this is pretty bad, but not as bad as other movies, I thought it moved along at a decent clip even if i was appalled by the comidee and finding it not funny.

So I Married An Axe Murderer,Kevin,"
I agree with everything  you guys have said about mike meyers in general and kinda this movie too.

At times I felt like. Disappointed realizing mike meyers is a one trick pony and realizing his schtick is fully there and the outlier with perfect encapsulation of him.

i found it fascinating. i really enjoyed watching this movie. for all of the bad and all of the good.

cameos? great.

michael richards is great and mike meyers does his anniversary thing and then michael richards is like we just doing this, and then mike meyers devolves into his bit but man this movie gives no fuck whatsoever as for carrying the viewer like ""yeah fuck you here's a comedic bit""

i dunno it was a frankenstein of different movie ideas.

i did like the conceit of an axe murderer romantic comedy. i found mike myers a charming boy and 2 woman central to the plot and 2 more wooooooooo oooo man = 4 units in total",4

I mean, you can hate it, there's a lot ot pick apart, like we did this evening, but its pretty damn charming, julie roberts is fantastic i see how she got so fuckin famous.

richard gere was kinda a wet blanket in this movie, but yeah gary marshall knows how to make a charming picture.

Roman Holiday,Kevin,"Jordan posed a question: ""is this movie trying to be a 4 quadrant movie?""

I don’t know, I like what this movie did and we awere talking about this movie in the night about 4 marilyne monroe movies but those seem to fit more into th emold that jordan is trying to look at like it fits inside a box but it refuses to beinside the box.

im not trying to rebut jordans critique of the movie but it falls inside why i find this movie fascinating and works for amovie coming from that time and  also we didnt talk about one scene that i flat out found fucking hilarous.

general passes out inject drugs uhhhhh thud on the ground.

general thuds on the ground.

so fuckin funny

and they delay it a beat. dude you fall on the ground. oo the general.

yeah i love this movie i had a blast like uh i found i dunno holly wood doing italian neo-realism was really interesting like ""hey heres the thing we are doing for world wide cinema like i dunno if they tryin to pull something like two fascinating moments in astrangth time like hackted dont fuppul off fully 4 humy handsy sonegoes mouth.",4
Romance and Cigarettes,Kevin,"I believe in johnson… cause masked and anonymous is cropping up a couple times tonight. That was another call that johnson missed. And that one hurt.

He came through with a review the next week. I dunno.

Ryan just thank you for picking this movie, im so fuckin glad i got to see it. its bad in all the right ways, yet simultaneously fascinating and kinda great? i dunno. im a whole mixed bag.

i gonna copout on a 3. the ending of this movie is not earned and at the end of it i feel for james gandalfini and susy sareenee.

the filmaking is solid enough tuturrro is goin for bloke and goin so fun and dirty and lewd and weird and, again, indy movies in the early 2000s tryin to create new weird new wave movies of 60s and 70s swings always there.

there was a lot of competency in the movie.

Secretary,Kevin,"
when johnson told me he was picking this movie a few weeks ago I was pretty excited because I remember being 13 or 14 reading the review in rolling stone magazine being like ""oooo this sounds like there's gonna be nudity in it, I should check it out!""

ive alwasy known about it and known it was supposed to be a funy kinky movie... was pretty let down by it. we touched on stuff like:

not displaying consent in the beginning- first spanking scene happened and aleysia screamed at the television and i kept waiting for the movie to i guess like... straighten itself out from that weird dynamic that was presented.

it always came across as creepy and inappropriate, until the movie was like oh its a rom com and they gonna get together and whatever.

ive read a bunch of reviews. the response to it left me very confused.

either way, movie left me feeling weird. 2 hairbrush bathroom spanks.",2
The Rocketeer,Kevin,"ummm so dis was a movie I have known about forever.

Since I was a kid ive known about the rocketeer.

Onlything I remember is timothy dalton burning up in a horrifying accident, so I was pumpt to get to fulfill a childhood goal of finally seeing this movie.

i was like, first half i was like, hm dont this is fine.

then the second half was having a ton of fun. Him flying around the restaurant was fun and i was like nothing but delighted when a german army showed up outta nowhere.

german vs mafia vs fbi sandbox give me everything. yeah i dunno i had a ton of fun watchin this movie.

I had heard wispers of this movie. The weekend before I watched this I was like ""is this that cannibal moovie?

for the first hour i was on board. diggin it, like obviously now they gonna torture this guy gonna be fun. and yeah. throughout the movie its been a minute since I kinda actively gotten mad at a movie  I watched and just been uh turn after turn what are you doing why are you doing this. and pretty much when whatever guy from lethal weapon finds out oh nope my throat didnt get slit like how much we have left like thank you for this pick thank you for this atrociousness thats been delivered. we been watching too many decent ass movies.

Is stellar about aliens?

Envious of this movie.

Its green but im not super positive about it. Tame green. Green of this season.

never knew of this movie. never seen anything about it. heard anything about it until alysia was like this is a movie from my childhood you should check it out.

not a billy cristil fan. honestly. 1 scene in princess bride. this movie does not make me a billy kristal fan but it does make me a danny devito fan.

i really liked his performance in this movie, its this movie is truly a mixed bag. i found it really interesting to watch.
the comedy really worked for me i found myself cracking up quite a bit.

his childlike performance is... i was fascinated by it. i cant say i necessarily defend it maybe it was exploiteative i dunno am i laughing at him, are the pathos real? its leaning into dark comedy but the movie doesnt want to put its full foot in its odd enough that like alright ill go along with this: 3 copies of mr pinksies 100 girls id like to pork.",3
Midnight Run,Kevin,"so.

My dad, taped this movie offa HBO onto VHS and like, I remember just growing up like you gotta watch VH1.

I'm 8 or nine. Hes like no, you cant watch it, it's R. You can't hear that language yet.

I was 10 or 11 and he let me watch midnight run. And... yeah. something about it stuck with me. It's just a great. the Deniro doing comedy at this point is perfect. I knew of Deniro as a tough, so watching him be so like, broadly comedic as a kid still works to this day.

i had a moment with a bit of a conflict. I was like... WOW this movie is like a solid dad movie. the fistophobia joke that's always been stuck in my head because my dad loved that joke.

There's others, i wish I knew what they were.

Then i was like, is Deniro capable of being a comedic actor? is he funnier in this or meet the parents?

what is this?

what is his performance like sort of trading in on?

cause like the moment with his daughter or wife really caught me off guard because he balances the ridiulousness and keeps it balanced and believable and charles grodin like, whatever you're doing keep it up man.

grodin was the reason to watch this movie, but unsure about deniro mainly as a comedic person.

but looved. yeah. i have a soft spot. i am entertained by agreeing with everyone that it hits that right sweet spot of an 80s action comedy so 4 non-counterfiet noncounterfiet 20s.",4
Hard-Boiled,Kevin,"yeah. I just was so happy watching this movie last night.

Kid in a candy store that was exploding with candy and flames.

they didnt use safety concerns or computer effects.

last shebang out on fuckin top.

no doubt its 5 day saving little piss pots.

it was really funny going through the logic of this movie and none of it makes sense.

its all kinda bad and i just dont care. it was one of thos wow i felt 10 years old watching a movie again in so long.

i said my peace. 5.",5
Toys,Kevin,"ummm.
This was a movie had always been curious about since I was a kid..

Then as I got older and maybe just. Influenced by. I dunno that I read any critical pieces on toys, just that its oh… this movie isnt the like ""shiny package that you think it was as a kid""

neither was it a weird adult movie that, the weird adult movie that you think it's gonna be.

i had preconcieved notions going into it. it neither met those and i dunno. i enjoyed watching this movie.

i uh, it was weird, it was disappointing in a lot of ways which we talked about.

i was always curious visually about what was going on screen. i feel like. yeah i dunno as a k. having the perspective of being a kid who wanted to see the movie and didnt get to see it til he was 32, 33 and knows what the movie is trying to do somehow made it better.

i feel like thats a slim group for what the target audience of what this movie tryin to hits.

i dunno i kinda liked it.

3 peas and carrots in a problematic puke pile.

The Last Emporer,Kevin,"it was, this movie definitely kept me intrigued throughout all of it. I know very little about what happened with china since mao's revolution I was like oh… modern china up to mao's revolution.

I was disappointed in the movie that it didn’t spoon feed me cultural events in china. you got the gist of it but it was all from the perspective of the emperor but he was so secluded from everything that even you the audience like you are watching it from this isolated persons perspective which was an interesting choice.

which did keep you.. it was a good choice to keep you with that character through constantly changing things.

i got a little frustrated with some of the second half because of the weird spy character and i was on board with it all the way through.

i felt caught off guard bythe final scene when he meets the child guard and finds the cricket thing. it was a capping moment to the fairytaleness that just sort of sealed it for me like oh yeah i really really enjoyed it gotta gvie it 4 turds in a bowl.",4
Strange Brew,Kevin,"Umm. Yeah. So rewatching

Equilibrium,Kevin,"ummm
yeah

so hadnt seen this movie.

Was excited to see in because of the auh, remembering about it highschool and then it started.

And I went ooo nooo.

Between the introductory title card scene in the first fight. I was like.

Oh man. I was no expecting this.

and then the movie started shoving along and i uh started getting into it.

at least like.

i dunno. i was just down with it.

i was like. it's stupid. its interesting enough from its time period. it had a very watchable cast.

i dunno. as i was watching it i was feeling like. yeah my kneejerk reaction was like a little unfair.

this movie does have something going on.

there was some cool action sequences. there was also soem really bad action sequesnces.

three taye diggs faces on a marble floor.

The Natural,Kevin,"alright so, yeah. Sam introduced me to this movie wen that was 1920 years old. Hey watch onna my favorite movies. Watched it. Loved it.

Was really taken away with it. And then hadnt I don’t know I don’t think I had rewattched it until last year and that was i might ahave been the frist time i rewatched it.

i got sick with noravirus i was out for 24 hours puking and shitting my pants and um. ive got nothin to do but watch movies all day today and i was like im gonna watch the natural

was watching and it it was just the movie was just the pace i wanted to be at.

it was slow it was magical i can just vibe with this movie and im sick as a dog and want nothing more to be just at the top of my game.

then when robert deniro redford is in a battle with his stomach. and its gonna cost him his life to play his game - me with my stomach vomitting and shitting every where i just went, this movie is like me right now.

this is what its like to be a baseball player and i just fully connected with this movie.

this is a movie metaphor about not shitting your pants. you dont have control of your bowels in this movie. if you gotta fart its like a liquid stream of diahreaa commin out yer ass.

Little Shop of Horrors,Kevin,"
this is one im pretty sure my parents showed me when I was a younger age.

Ive always know it as some sort of ""fresh"" viewing.

Watching it, I gotta admit like, its… its very open presence as a musical (while I appreciate it hits you in the face with it) and its like take you in the face this is what you are getting...

im like jordan, im not a musical person.

i found it really funny like with some songs and i liked the way it used musical constraints and filmed itself as a stageplay.

motorcycle flies outta the sky and lands, that shit cracked me up, presenting itself as this larger than life sorta thing.

i was also not.. i just wasnt keen on the songs.

there was something about them that didnt click with me, even if i... i liked how they were maybe placed or worked within the story.

they got everything across but when they were happening i was slightly disengaged.

even something like suddenly seymour. i feel like this should be working for me objectively like... its there... emotionally i feel like i want what its supposed to be doing but its not delivering for me.

maybe its a matter of taste or not a good song or whatever, when ryan said these guys did a disney score and maybe it felt like a band making their first album figuring something outa long the way. didnt full click but i really relaly like a lot of this stuff even if ti didnt fully click.

so i lean 3 glitterly shiba tulip duliply things.",3
Uncle Buck,Kevin,"um

*unintelligble*

this was another piggy back offa ryan and johnson: this was a movie where my dad was like ""you gotta watch uncle buck""

I knew I seen it in some kinda pieced together fashion on the cable channels all the time, but it was never one where I sat down and truly watching.

we never read it, so i never saw the script.

there was enough of it that couldnt escape the cable sensors where my kid-brain could remember what it was but I never connected with it in the way that you had those movies with nostalgia lense.

so watching it... last night... was sort of like -- i knew it was gonna happen in the end, but i could not really even... could not even remember what the hell happend for the first 9/10ths of the movie.

reinforced what i love about john candy, john hughs movie was planes trains and automobiles which i wanna rectify.

i had a great time with the movie even though it had warts.

Office Space,Kevin,"uuuuuuh yeah. Awah what can I say that hasn’t been said?

This was the comedy central movie for me.

I know I said earlier "" I don’t think that I got it"" and I kept rewatching it, and I think it was one of those first movies where I finally understood what a cult movie was.

the sort of movie where you start quoting it amongst friends and its like ""ah yeah, they get it too""

rewatching i was like yeah.

so much seeped into be just browsed forums on reddit where you quote office space and get upvoted immediately.

forgetting so many quotes from this movie cause hadnt watched in a while.

so loved getting to remember it its a classic its a 4 bob movie for me.

The Karate Kid,Kevin,"
okay, so its my turn.

I enjoyed a lot of this movie.

To kinda take pieces from other peoples reviews, johnson looking at it from a kid angle.

There was one point where I thought this movie was taking too long.

Had I watched it as a kid i think it wouldnt have held my interest.

it just took too much time to get going.

and as a kid that would have either bored me or watching the main character suffer a little too much at the hands of the bullies.

can we just get to the jackie chan and karate kid?

once it started going i wa slike this is fun and the crazy shit like the cobra woman.

a lot of the humor worked, like him trying to mind trick his mom was really funny

i also felt conflicted during this movie, while the aging down to twelve year olds made the drama better, theres something about the action where my adult brain just couldnt conform with it in a way.

jackie chan shouldnt be beating up these kids, nor should these kids be going so hard on each other

mostly i tuned that side of my brain out and i was like yeah ""beat the fuck out of each other""

the scene where jackie chan gives jaden a shirt that looks like bruce lee wore in a movie, my head thought jackie chan was presenting him a piece of bruce lees actual garments.

what the fuck is happening in this movie?

yeah, it broke my brain for a little bit.

pulling out i realized how i was wrong. but i thought that was funny

Dhoom,Kevin,"ill go next.

Yeah I… I guess I had more fun with the conversation than I did for most of the movie. I did have a lot of fun for most of the movie. In no way did I think it was all that great.

It's an interesting way to do it. But yeah. I kinda kept trying to uh. What is a terrible hollywood movie from this time, if you showed this to someone from another culture or some other thing. I came up a little blank. It's silly, fun mostly ridiculous. Still only worthy of two removed sunglasses.",2
Inu-Oh,Kevin,"I watched this movie this morning with many cups of coffee and… I had a real good time with it.

It was having seen night is short walkon girl was.. I uh. I very much enjoyed the streamlined narrative of it. But then kinda allowed the visuals to break off and bea  little more wild.

even though we did piece of a little of it tognith, it was relatively easy viewing. i was moved by the.. freindship between inu-oh and tomari, i was moved by the eventual turn of the govt being like ""nah cant do their art we need our 1 streamlined narrative""

emotionally i think it hit all the good beats and really enjoyed it so four cursted elongated armz.

Super Mario Bros.,Kevin,"yeah.

I would imagine the holllywood pitch meeting went something like:

""so in naked lunch, we got an exterminator killin bugs as a metaphor for herione addiction and closeted homosexuailty. So instead what if instead we did video game characters that are plumbers killing dinosaurs that are a metaphor for rampant domestic abuse and closeted homosexuality.""

i kept watching super mario bros. and thinking that this was naked lunch but with dinosaurs.

We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story,Kevin,"I'll go next please.

Um. I agree with sam about the voice acting and some of the animation being a distraction and really taking me out of the movie.

For the first third I just never felt centered in it.

With just bringing me into the world. I had to like... force myself to like... almost like notice what was going on. 

but um. as it chugged along I watched this with alecia last night - -i should say.

alecia grew up with this movie and had childhood memories associated with it.

it got to the end and i was like: goddamnit, i wish this was 20 or 30 minutes longer, i never got to see cool stuff that were emotional beats for me. i was like yeah i guess we are here now, but i was like... i cant hate on the message of this movie because it is on the end of the day i think trying to teach about love and empathy with the curing of Rex and bringing him out of the brain drain, everyone should do that.

yeah - love and empathy will make you turn not into a lizard brain.

from a parents perspective is like all i get is 63 minutes and have my kid zoom in and be entertained by dinosaurs, i guess i dont have to be entertained as a parent. but you could entertain me as well.

I landed on two circuses with the notion of Spiiieeeece.",2
Blood Simple,Kevin,"um.

This is my second viewing. I haven't seen it since the end of college and that viewing was like I said, very like…. Confused and underwhelmed. (just whelmed)

it was almost like a first viewing.

I know its like a murder plot. I thought they robbed the bar. I had that going into my head. I remember francis fighting for my life in my head. 

I know its not the movie i remember but I had the same feelings. Complete misunderstandings. I. Gotta be honest. I was really proud of myself.

I felt really smart watching this movie and picking up on shit. This second time around I was like ""oh thats why I didnt get this""

I think its yeah really interesting to see where the cohen brothers started and how much this movie is and isnt like the rest of their stuff.

Lot of great scenes in this movie that does somthese movies equal to the parts of the movie 4 curtains.",4
Gattaca,Kevin,"I had a very kneejerk reaction to watching this movie last night.

I had a great time watching it.

I really do stand by the thought - were this a novel. It just had realy good bones.i would love to read someones 400 pages novelization before it became a movie because i thought it brought up interesting ethical questions for the time and classism questions.

and then the movie was basically like, nah, its just a murder mystery with 50s noire sci-fi stuff because you like that style of filmmaking.

either way i had such a blast watching this but then i woke up in the morning and i was like, everything i watched last night was bullshit and i questioned everything.

this conversation solidified so i gotta give it 5 chickenshitunmichaelphelps like brothers wtf.

Every Which Way But Loose,Kevin,"one other pop cultural reference I had going into this movie, I don’t know if you guys heard cass mcomb songs, there's this song where he's trying to woo some 15 year old white trash girl.

The song is called ""rancid girl"" and he's calling her a rancid girl throughout the entire song. so if it was a clint eastwood film... then it would be a fun piece of pop-late-70s-trash.

clint eastwood is a nogood barenuckleboxer wooin women with his orangutan friend.

i was like wow I gave gattaca 5 stars, so i was like how the fuck am i going to defend this movie.

but then the movie literally tanked in the second half, and then it was like no clint is a better guy than this clint eastwood guy, and then i was like fuck this movie's got heart.

yeah.

im just glad i dont have to like. it didn't knock gattaca off the post, so gattaca still has 5 whatever i gave it out of and this one has 3 pissen shittin fartins and ass lickens.",3

Blow Out,Johnson,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. Visually really really awesome, really like the story. Felt like a story being retold. Felt like there were holes in it, like when you are telling a story everyone knows, you only leave in the really fun cool bits, but leave out the boring parts. motivations of characters were confusing, had to do a lot of assupmtins didnt really matter. did really really like it. i think of all fo the movies we atched so far, this one i would be most interested in seeing a remake. minor tweaks in the writing to make this unbelieveablly cool. sam: ""iphone shit, f that"". scene trying to find her in subway, with better writing that scene would be movie gold. it was good but it wasnt right there. having said that really really enjoy it. 3 screams (now thassa good screem). Shag: this is a remake. depalma was inspired and made his version of it. not a remake more of an inspiration. johnson: the scene where hes recording really really got me. was on the edge of my seat, so spooky skeletons would love to see redone. whats the name? blowup->blowout->blowme babee (blowjob) (blow) (whats his head right about cocain?)

The Woman,Johnson,so. Um. Going into this one. I think the film rewards the watcher. The beginning was intriguing. I had questions from the beginning til it ended. They were never resolved. I had questions about characters who endd up getting murdered anyway. give me more of these bizarre films. this was clearly some interesting persons vision. they pushed it through. i liked some of the weirdness. the main guy character an dhis family while i didnt udnerstanding him at all why is he such a monster strange weird phsycopath wife is so placating and bizaare really interesting not a good way tomake agoodo movie didn get tired watching it for sure what else i hope the whole movie was the end but the beginnign didint give a fuck th emusic choices were unbelivesabley jarring the same guy at least the after credit scene featuring darlin didnt make any goddamn sense you had to wait til the end the watched long enough to see the after credits scene this has to mean something megs this is a horror movie and megs after 10 minutes what the fuck is up with this movie. shit. shit. shit. this movie started as a solid two kissing on a one wen tinto a an adrelinate packed might of been foor felt like asshole wracked my brain dont want to go with my gut gud as 4 remember the ending hating fucking confused a 3 eaten bloody hearts in a hand.,3
Phantasm Two,Johnson,"this movie started off lightening fast. This is definitely a jordan movie. He has been complaining about movies that take too long. Why are you listening to me (jordan).

didnt have more to say other than i really liked it. most of the movie i really didnt like arnold. thought he was kind of an asshole. through this discussion i realized that maybe he was like a practical joker and i think he was incredibly charasmatic i really kinda liked him even more glad to have lived in a state he was the governonr of this movie 4 types of poeple who are the types of dgo to bite back",4

I thought th eactors portrayal was all style based from the get. This fell into that place like the movie kids. im fascinated by early 90s what the hell are kids getting away with in this city. love the genre love the era.

i liked that it was a gay movie that wasnt overlly sexualized. made this realize eazy to watch.

Gone in 60 Seconds,Johnson,"um. So from the very beginning it had that jerry bruckheimer look with the colors and the score.

Loved thes oundtrack. The dialogue was tough at points and pretty cliché. But I don’t think that actually hurt he film. Cause the film was about the cars baby it was all about the cars.

a lot of the car scenes were filmed like a young man with hot wheels. not a criticism thought it was really really really good.

the good outshined the bad in this film. this is one i could watch over and over in the background mostly. that hungover sunday test of afilm this is one i could watch forever.

Gone in 60 seconds was fun with actors making choices and malkovich made strange + bizarre choices and I didn’t like it and never got bored in that aspect.

I knew it was going to be mostly visual just like ti was recommended to me because it was so visually cool.

i lubbed looking at it. the constant mirrors had my brain saying ""wat dis?"" ultimately it wasnt there. the metaphores never turned out i really enjoyed it all the same.

there are a number of scenes that were neato to look at i looked back and said ""wat dis mean?""

did it make sense for a 2 hour long movie? i dunno.

i truly enjoyed this movie. will i see it again, prolly not. i enjoyed this movie beginning to end.

guy noire so out of place and why is this character involved but i think it was written with very good care and i foudn it indearing i really really likeed it

he got beans as a chaser and i just thought relaly like loved that

um

anythign else. certain choisced by garrisseon keeler i thought were bizzar but not a bad thing i guess i just gave some leeway in some of the writing a radio guy writing his first movie

loved the style of shooting. loved the zoom ins that were kinda cliche now but not then.

i laughed a lot, the dubbing felt almost like mxc or kung pow enter the fist where i was giggling at it thinking it was a joke.

the story, while fun, i didnt really follow it. i think i got the gist of it but i think it could have been better.

ill just read what I wrote after finishing this movie last night pretty inebriated.

What did it mean? I don’t know.

Maybe it was too much story being pushed into one story.

Maybe this manga is super deep and extra details crammed in but didnt work right

great reif movie. perfect no. night is long walkon girl was better.

without seeing visuals would not have enjoyed this movie very much. it had animation issues, it was always interesting to look at.

Dashelss caracter was really thought out and good arc.

I thought it was shot really well. My eyes really liked to see this film. I liked it.

thats where the fun ended for me.

the main character was a phsycopath. he was jealous without any empathy. he liked, i guess a girl but he showed no real possession her was part of movie but ends up with her but it wasnt.

i dunno i just didnt like it it was this gross yuppie thing and um throughout our talk we talk about how its implied that all these characters come from money oh i guess so it kinda makes sense and makes me hate them more.

yeah... i dunno. maybe the cultural difference betwen the 90s and now suggests that the 90s are gross.

i dislike the 90s. and these characters.

as not a jealous character i dont connect with the movie either.

um. yeah. the part about therapy is where people grow. the main character wanting to be in it is actively not growing at all but if he ends up with the girl at the end it makes zero sense he should lose for not growing.

in conclusion i liked the way ti looked. i like the humor. i hated the characters. i dont want to watch it again. this will be rounded up to 2 group therapy sessions with peter bogdonovich.",2

This was nostalgiac for me I was happy to watch it in my gramparents house and my mom and uncle were laughing so hard and it was a cool experience when the jokes went over my head. that built up in my head that it was going to be really good.

there were tons of stars in it i was like ooo i want to talk about this, ultimately the movie was chaos.

it was a jumbling of SNL bits thrown on top of each other on top of a facade of a linear plot.

this movie is not to be watched by yourself in a basement on your laptop. this is a movie to be watched with friends doing low scale drugs or drinking with friends. this was a low scale movie.

jack black i had no clue who he was, overall i really did enjoy this.

The greek kind of everybody but the human world was fine. The end was tremendous.

I was confused about who it was for, i feel like they could have rewrote the monkeybone to not be about boners, and then the movie would have made less sense. something we would not have loved and it was cultish and dirty and blue and stuck in this spot who is this movie geared twoards and it made it suffer a little bit.

I tought it was cool l loved seeing them all intoxicated together like seeing them as adults next weekends hang which is really relaly fun martins character was incredibly intereting he made me so sad everytime i looked at him he has the saddest face on the planet... it just made me sad..

what else did i hav eto say about it. i did write this sthi movie was a bad infulence at one point. drinkin sazeracs with the boys lissnen to relly cool music you can buuy your wine palmer fresh cod.

this movie worked really well i hate danish language on my ears.

the visuals were so good i wanted to stop looking at the subtitles to enjoy what was on the screen so i rewond but at home its not a big deal but on the big screen cant do it the same.

i am looking forward to hakes next major screenplay.

this felt like something shage would write and film the framing was a daniel jacobson film (t)

overall gonna have to give this a 3 with a point in front with B. A. C.",3
Lapsis,Johnson,"I think this movie was trying to make an indictment against capitalism but the vehicle was flawed and not well explained. Big hang up

I wish that the cards would have been scarier. I do like that it was like a teamup with collge thats interesting.

wish the cable or quantum companies were scarier.

really what the hell is with the connecting cubes with cables, why is it a constant requirement. sems like a bad deisgn for a computer.

wanted weird shifts in reality due to quantum fields, you know like people scared of 5g. like if i t was bonkers like that but since it wasnt super bonkerss the need to run cables on the surfance to enable high speed trading or somethign i dont know.

i feel like this movie was trying to make a big statment and i was rooting for it and it was supposed to be engaging but it ididnt keep up the crazy i dont think ill watch this film again..

it was an enjoyable ride 2 completely out of place pillow fights.",2
The Skin I Live In,Johnson,"ok so, I picked this movie knowing zero about it. Im not even quite sure why I picked it, but I guess im glad I picked it.

It was interesting, I think the director was trying to make us have certain feelings for all the major characters then our intial feelings got kind of clouded in the middle but then at the end it gets swithed around.

rapist -> phsyco
rapist -> dr

in the film it could have been better. i like what shag said i think the core concept was the issue was interesting and they kinda backed into it and the backing into it was problematic.

antonio banderes holy shit he was awesome to watch. the tiger scene will live on in movie club lore for just being a crazy scene with a lot of opinions but all together it was a gross scene. yeah, i loved the conversation tonight but i wont let it affect my score i think this one shot right down the middle for this one and im gonna give it 3 nonconsentual vaginaplastys",3
Sorcerer,Johnson,"so, I loved the comment that I didn’t know earlier that this was friedkin's favorite film to shoot, because I think that mirrors my opinion. This movie feels like a highlight reel of the director and his skills. Variation of shots, special effects, the vibes created throughout the film were really really good. i liked the performances he got out of the actors too.

i felt like this movie could have been edited better. could have been tidied up and more punchy. loved the music.

loved the characters in the jungle, tension in the vehicle scenes, working with each other. wisht ehre was more character development in the jungle.

this movie did a lot of things but didnt make a choice about wha tit was tright to do. you figure it out. ywould have like to know what more of wha tit was going for .

i did enjoy it when i was watching it. it wasa  lot of fun, even thought we nitpicked it here maybe it was little too harsh on it with freinds i would watch it totally confident giving it 3 drips of nitrogen nitroglycerine",3
Shogun Assassin,Johnson,"uh. So this was like a cool drink of water. This was so refreshing to watch, not saying nothing bad about them but this was waesome. This was awesome.

Loved this one cant believe I seen it before. Kid narrator pretty good. Fuedal japan was super dope. fight scenes give me more and more blood fuckin dig it. sound track dig it. if that car had more blades possible i say load it up. the cart could hav emore blades love the tropes this was fantanstic img ivin this an easy 4 swords.",4
Driven,Johnson,"I was really excited to do a car / racing movie. I was way too excited.

Even at the beginning I saw mario andretti at the beginning and im like this is gonn abe dope! And then I twas real bad.

I couldn’t get over that there were two separate women in the film who had been with two different racecar drivers and that was just... normal.

i think we touched on it. im glad that while it was creepy and sexist it didnt get overtly sexual so saving grace there.

thank god it was written and starred in by sly stallone instead of steve segall that would haunt my nightmares.

this gets a 1 distressed denim cowboy hats.",1
Exit Wounds,Johnson,"um.

Another steve segall film.

Another one that seems handwritten by him to constantly give him compliments to tell him how hot and powerful and how much of hero he was

but that didn’t irritate me this time.

Lvoed the action, the cars was funny, prepped for cool stuff to talk about

young eva mendez. tom alrnold was funny

i thought tk was funny

loved unlimited bullets in every scene

wish it went more extra, just turn it up to 11 if you gonna be crazy, i guess heroin t-shirts kinda

wish that the commander would have gotten a better ending, that was a real bummer

this was like movie club movie the entire time i was fuckin pumped i lvoed it

loved the dmx music, and dmx suprised me.

i thought he was gonna be garbage, but he was passable.

so yeah, i loved it

segall, named his character orin, that was annoying.

lvoed it. give this bad boy 4 starchy heron turdshurts",4
Pink Flamingoes,Johnson,"so I agree this was at an end of spectrum of movies I guess I had never experienced, so In that way im glad this was picked. This was a great movie night pick. I really enjoyed how visceral I felt. Like I felt this movie more than I felt the other ones..

none of the movies made me want to throw up through it.

i pride myself on... i fasted forwarded through part of that gaping butthole scene.

it made me feel. snuff films i dunno. that part i really liked.

it was genuinely funny. any movie that says turd a bunch will satisfy my lessor humor urges.

i really did like all of those things.

the moment i finished this movie i wa slike holy shit im gonna give this a 1. the acting, cinematography, acting, this movie felt like the way you would edit a movie with your first video camera and if you fucked up a scene too bad.

its in there forever.

but i do, it reminded me a lot of mysteries of the organism.

it was arty trying to say something that was just out fo reach. maybe thats just me tyring to givne it too much credit.

imma give 1. keep this typ eof weird fuckin crazy mind opening. im gonna give this the highest honor i can give it 2 gaping butholes.",2
Three The Hard Way,Johnson,"im ready to go.

Yeah so uh I really am really pumped everyone joyed this and scratched the iteches

I was really hpoing this wasn’t going to be terrible cause I was you know didn’t know anythign about it and I didn’t want to pick another medium raw

i did agree with everybody that 70s super seriosu really fun crazy gunfights explosions really enjoyable. just enough plot to not be stupid.

you could really follow and just having 3 main characters who had fun dialogue and they seemed super cool with each other really really like dit.

yeah making nazis the badguys: perfect.

i did not need complexiity  i needed something *no pun* black and white. it went down smooth

super pumped everyone enjoyed i would like to watch at can can somenight 4 patriotic topless biker torturers",4
Mallrats,Johnson,"this was the first time I had ever seen this movie, which seems kind of crazy, I really enjoyed it.

Right off the bat, I really loved just watchign movies that know they are movies.

Its not trying to tick me into being something real, its played for the camera.

this movie was play really well as a funny highschool aged stage production. that would be awesome.

this seemed written for the stage, really liked the comedy beats, jay and silent bob, every time on screen i was laughing out loud.

i agree what everyone else said our main two heros, kinda tough to watch.

jason lee, he's awesome, i love watching him talk, but his character annoyed me the whole time, jeremy london.. we already talkin bout him.

this movie def be stronger if they lost at the end instead of winning.

i enjoyed it. iddnt look at me phone engaged em.

im gonna gvie a zero hot takes score of 3 melted chocolate stink palmbs. chocolate coverated stink plambs.",3
Ishtar,Johnson,"so. Yeah. I liked a lot of moments in this film. I watche dit by myself and reround to watch the scenes again because they were so funny.

Otherwise, long long scenes and cuts of the movie like: wtf is going on?

The movie didn’t take itself super seriously, so i didnt. I thought i missed a lot because of this conversation. There were chunks missing.

i thought this movie made me feel kind of silly. i must have fallen asleep.

the lead characters had good relationship. it could have been better but i liked how both characters were stupid and one thinks they are smart.

im incredibly glad to have seen this movie, i think it was a cool pick, thank you shag for doing it, i feel lik my life is better having watched it, thus im going to give this aaaaaaaaa 2 roberts, rogers and clark hit records.

*heckling ensues*
",2
Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000,Johnson,"Jordan: Dig it.

This movie felt super long. Like I said, I paused this a lot.

Every time I was super stunned that three minutes had gone by.

The beginning of the story felt like a startreck episode. End jumped the shark, but not in a way i enjoyed.

maybe if i liked it or enjoyed it like a comedy, maybe i would really enjoy it but it seemed like it, it made me sleepy i would say.

travolta's acting was, um... it definitly kept my attention, it made me chuckle a lot of times, he was tryin somethin, he was tryin somethin.

aliens ugly, dope.

learning machine super stupid.

zero chance i watch battlefield earth again.

1 cyclo genociderz.
",1
Waiting to Exhale,Johnson,"so I came in to this kind of critical of this movie.

I thought the ah. Iinfidelity and excuses for it were just so blatant or morally bankrupt or something, but.

This conversation has been really really good and I think it changed my perspective a bit and i realized that its a bit more complicated and uh. whats the word?

looking for. uh. finessed the relationships. the range of human emotion or something.

this conversation changed my mind there. really loved that happening loved the way it was told all 4 actressess were really really good. i would love to watch this.

really love that holly was on this call to give that some perspective too.

because of that i will give this a 3 enduring friendships :)",3
Predestination,Johnson,"alright, so.

I dig time travel moobies.

I don’t usually think they do it very well, but using the single character aspect had my brain just really really diggin it the whole way through.

Yeah so came into this loving it, realized you bozos dont think about it hard enough, becuause you are too simple minded go back to watching to wait to exhale.

4 flaming faces.

*reactions*

Sam: That was the least johnson review. not questioning, confidently saying your thing like a badass.",4
Mamma Mia,Johnson,"First off, I love musicals! Truely I do. I think they are really fun and I just get into them. This movie was colorful and silly and I know I should haven't taken it seriously, but maybe I did a little too much. The story was really dumb and I was constantly looking around to ask someone ""what the heck is going on?!"". This whole thing seemed like a weird cash grab and I wasn't a fan. I really liked this conversation though and it has affected my score for sure. With that I give this bad musical a 2 TBDs!
",2
Brilliantovaya ruka,Johnson,"I was really excited to do this movie, seeing a foreign film that was soviet influenced.

Thought there was a lot of mr magoo and mr bean inferences. I liked doofus bumbling around making mistakes.

Its not high art and it doesn’t speak against power or anything like that. but i thoroughly enjoyed this. great movie nite pick.

really wanna give this a 4 but like i dont know if it gets to that echelon, would love to watch this drinking vodka with a drink of my boys 3 robes with mother of peral buttons.",3
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,Johnson,"I haven't watched as much batman as everyone else here. So I was excited to see this one again,. I liked it but it wasn't my favorite. I'm excited to watch more batman stuff after this conversation. So I'll give it 3 batarangs.

",3
Victor/Victoria,Johnson,"im gonna continue sams momentum. I really loved this movie. The first time I paused this was 45 minutes in because I had to go pee, I was like holy shit I gotta go pee and we are only 45 minutes in. I should have timed it.

Hahahahahha.

I was loving this film. i loved the uh, chemistry between the main two characters and i lvoed the quick insults, they were so good, the performances were fantastic. julie andrews is a vocal gem.

i really liked the whole thing with King, i voiced my criticisms, i wish it would have been pushing boundaries to the next level. I could have written a better ending.

all that said, holy shit did i enjoy this, the whole time watching it, megs watched this with me, i was like holy shit this one might be a 5, i dunno. this is hittin me different.

this conversation did nothing to change that, add this to the top tier of movies with movie club, im gonna give it 5 norma's small rages.",5
Drop Dead Gorgeous,Johnson,"so watching this I was definitely bummed that I didn’t watch this when I was 13 or 14. this had so many references that I think woulda been really funny upper tier maybe in my childhood if I watched it then.

Having said that, I was nervous going into this, while i thought it was funny, i wasnt sure how much everyone would dwell on the problematic stuff even if it could bog you down everyone had the exact same kinda liked it but problematic stuff thought was funny when i was 12 or 13 not funny now but laughed at the time.

thought i was gonna give 3 but this one gonna stay with me more so im comfortable giving it 4 melted beercanhands.
",4
The American Astronaut,Johnson,"really loved the concept. And this conversation has been amazing, and has painted this film in a new light where I do think that it will probably continue to grow on me like a cult film.

I have to be true to how I was feeling while I watched this movie, because i paused it and only 8 minutes had gone by.

part of watching by myself, i guess i really needed a plot, and since it iddnt have a plot it put me in a bad mood and i wasnt having it.

i would have asked to atomize and pull in pile dust so i give it 1 cigarrettes",1
Bones,Johnson,"I was really excited picking this film, because when I said it, people cheered. Fucking yes, I nailed it.

Before I watched it, some of the text messages started rolling in, like a reference to medium raw. And I was like oh no, did I just medium raw dogg my friends again. oh my god i was discgusted.

i liked the intro, it lagged in the middle doing to o muhc, main complaintes about movies this comes hard in that third act. we have been wanting a 3rd act, i liked ending on a good note, i think going into tonight this was a 2, but this conversation gave me more of an appreciation for it. it was absurd in the right ways and didnt get problematic and overall i thought as far as silly stupid horror movies go this one was fuckin fun and had great effects and th eblood was terrible but really good so im gonna give this 3 spooky maggot rain-houses.",3
Zombi 2 (Zombie Flesh-Eaters),Johnson,"the skipper of the movie must be a real turkey.

I enjoyed the silliness of this movie. I think one of the faults is that there are other zombie movies that are better.

I don’t want to compare to other movies because that’s tough sometimes.

the music worked but it was more of a detriment.

i liked the craziness of it. the shark scene will stick with me for a long time. i thought "" what the fuck is happening""

the gore was repulsive such as the eye gouge and big bites. i almost had to squint my eyes, which was awesome.

ultimately, part of it was tough was that i didnt care about the characters and didnt feel anything.

in the end, while i loved the twist ending with new york, it couldnt quite do it.

yeah, i am ultimately glad i watched it. 2 tits out scuba divers.",2
Tales From the Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood,Johnson,"kevin: noooo im dropping down in my likeability of movies. Guys pick better movies.

Jordan: what is that? Total score? Total stars?

Johnson: I blacked out through a lot of this film. It kept my eyes attention (boner) but none of it really stayed in my brain.

but nothing really mattered. Dennis Miller was atrocious. i hated everything in it. the bones of the film coulda been fun if executed differently.

the gore was awesome. the gross out cool horror parts were done really solidly. i know the director did quite a few of the tv show, and he had the chops but some of the other stuff fell flat.

im not angry i watched it and i dont wanna give it a 1. i would throw this on the background cause its weird and cool to look at. no 1 cause not angry but cant give 3 cause ""yikes"" so imma give this 2 express trains to tuna town.",2
Possession,Johnson,"so, this was a tough one for me, because it was really really hard to follow.

We brought it up that you should let this film wash over you… once I realized the acting was a choice and not just bad. Then I watched movie.

The cinemtography gave me nausia.

I guess I'm not totally sure what this film is trying to say, i guess it was just a confusing, visceral, trying to get down what feeling though a divorce and it's just chaos.

this one didn't set super great with me. i was upset at it a couple of times. is this gonna be my first zero? I dunno.

but it's not. I don't know what it was gonna try to say. I'll give it 1 trashcan feather.",1
Misery,Johnson,"*clears throat*

I feel like so many times we watch these films and they do one act really well and maybe 2 acts and then it falls apart and makes the whole thing a slog.

This one was fantastic to watch and I really really liked it. It was tight filmmaking, loved the shot selection, felt very alfred hitchcock and cathy bates is amazing and james kaan his joices were so cool and very believable and yeah. *meow*

every scene had something i really enjoyed, no faults on this, this is kind of a boring review. when it comes to horror this one creeps up on you in a really really good way, this film doesnt bash you over the head.

its weird to discuss a legitimately good movie on here, so it gets 5 bitchly cow corns.",5
Someone's Watching Me!,Johnson,"coward

thanks

I agree with a lota things hake said. I really enjoyed this one.

Th emade for tv aspect lowerd my expernctations which made me enjoyed it more.

Im not a super real knowledgable about the johncarpenter work, instead of like sam.


my own ignorance made my experience better. be dumber sam.

i enjoyed the characters and a liked what the movie going for gave leeway made for tv.

yeah i guess i imagined constraints in my brain making me like it even more

the psychological elements made it like hitchcock and the reality seeing and nobody believing. horrifying and liked it.

really hated the ending, hated that the bad guy i just hated that it wasnt a mystery that the badguy was just a random person taht whatever.

overall enjoyed so for that it is a bad it is not a good movie its a made for tv movie it is what it is comfortable 3 almost grabbed shards of glass. no hot takes from johnson.

sam didnt make it feel like it one instead of jordan. gave me 3 instead 4 incredible one.

chasm between 3 and 4 is pretty big and 4 and 5 is massive. especially for me where 3 is like no mans land

i regret 3 2 is in my heart i said 3 cant go back.",3
Phantom of the Paradise,Johnson,"ill go.

Initially totally understand why this is a cult film, riding the same vein as rocky horror.

This movie had like little prince, I understood the metaphors and see what im trying to see.

It was insane and kooky.

I loved the visuals really enjoyed the music.

casting was solid.

parts were rushed, but kept the pacing of the movie quick, so i didnt get bored.

i guess i kinda played my hand throughout i really really enjoyed this film. this was a cool glass of water. definitely deserved 4 beef for me.",4
The Lady From Shanghai,Johnson,"so I thought this was a pretty great movie for movie club. I havent seen orsen welles, accent was crazy, what the hell is going on, keep me really engaged, got halfway excited through the conversation.

Funhouse stuff and the court room scenes were really entertain.

thought was really funny at the end, wish it was as funny as end. payoff was a little... you know, coulda been cooler at the end but not mad at it. overall this doesnt fall into stuff im stoked to watch again but im ultimately really glad i talked about. closed to a 4 but a 3 sweaty excitable grizbees.",3
Naked Lunch,Johnson,"firstoff super pumped that everybody seemed to have enjoyed this one.

Picking it it would be fun or really everyone hates me

even after watching I was like, man this coulda go every way.

Loved the coloring of this one. The vibe was bright and really cool.

obviously practical effects were amazing. 

weller being cast was a break or make for this film. he was capitvating in the way he portrayed bill lee.

surrealism, sometimes i hate it and sometimes i dig it. this time i dig it.

i had zero idea what was going on but i dont understand the plot really well, but this time it was teasing me and i just they about to tell me and the ending happened and confused me even more.

that was th emost perplexing scene of the whole movie.

my initial thought was fuuuck that.

then at work i could not stop thinking about what the movie was trying to say, realizing its more of a biography, elevated it more in my mind.

looking forward to seeing again. truly dont understand what happened. really really liked it.

with shag this is a sold 3 for me. throughout the conversation, before seeing reviews. dont wanna be swayed give stick with my gut 3 sips with my mugup jhisms.

jordan: i thought you were gonna be a fuckin stolen valor punk.

johnson: it made me feel better

johnson: we will see it's legs.

sam: reference for a wahile

jordan: till action boys.",3
Go,Johnson,"
I really enjoyed this movie, went in with zero expectations except tat my little experience with swingers I wanted good color and goods shots.

I liked interesting angles, late 90s time capsule feel to it. I dunno got me right into it, raves drugs house music, lets fuckin go.

the stakes were higher and noone died or injured was feel like after school special in a way

didnt make me hate it, thought movie coulda been way better

so many ways could be so much worse. dialogue was fun action was fun i dont have negative things to say about this one.

yep

so was it fantastic? absolutely not, but i thoroughly enjoyed watching this from beginning to end, big plus to me.

this was like nekked lunch solid 3.5 shit right here. didnt push enough of the buttons to push over ed so honest 3 crunchy herbal rave-shits.

Riders of Justice,Johnson,"gives review.

Another madds mikkelson foreign language film im for him so far ive liked both of em decent amounts.

Thought this was pretty funny see a scene and o wait that’s a joke laugh at myself

I thought the nerds didn’t annoy me as much as other people and tey were all stupid in their own way and really funny bumbling dufuses and technical knowhow and social salamis that amde them lovable for so reason

outa all of the characters i dislike mads the most cause he doesnt grow and is one note and mads acted it well but fell flat. everyone else was really cool.

overall thought it was funny thought it was cool.

nothing means anything everything is chaos everything is random right down the middle with three chubby salamis.

Sam: that's a nice little snack.",3
Broadcast News,Johnson,"I got really excited at the beginning of this conversation because I think that disagreement sometimes leads to the most fun conversations.

So I really enjoyed that aspect of that conversation about Tom, and I realize I came across coming across a fuckin tom apologist which is really bizarre.

it kind of made me think more of ""someones watching me"" in certain scenes.

good storytelling, the story was kinda bland, but the way it was told was well executed.

i thought it was funny and endearing and clever.

wasnt best picture worthy or anything like that.

so yeah... i think we discussed it really well already. its better than a 3 but not good enough to be  a 4. so 3 orange concentrated screwdrivers. 3 screwdrivers from concentrate.",3
Matinee,Johnson,"ill be here but im gonna pee.

So didn’t know anything about this film at all but john goodman had me excited.

Loved how silly ths movie was even thought not taking itself seriously. Watching through eyes of 12 / 13 me. Yeah I would've awe man i wish there was a movie in my hometown coulda gone through woulda been so cool.

i smiled and laughed through this whole thing cool drinka water neice and nephew and Mant! was so funny every time it cam eon the screen really really digging it.

i dunno wholesomeness really strucken to me, but was great movie? no, but i go with gut and give 4 shopping cart uncles.",4
Playtime,Johnson,"so I felt like I know this was an art house movie but this felt like something I would find myself standing in front of a screen at an art museum and each scene I would see people in their apartments and like ""this one is boring"" and then they all kind of ""i dunno"" i liked the geometric shapes and sterility of it and hyper choreographed nature of itall.

then restaurant absurd chaos and all that goes awy and just so interested to look at. im usually hyper critical of movies with zero plot but this one felt good to me.

i enjoyed watching but more about talking abou tit more. better to watch in a group and better to watch a second time and then i would rewind and you see some gag in the background and i was like ""omg thats so cool"" and i like when tehre is some stuff going on everywhere.

conversation really took it to 4 territory. im kinda conflicted.

jordan interjects - you liked it more than me and i gave it a 3.

but no. i think this one had enough, really fresh something for my eyes and ears. something i would nota picked on my own gonna go with 4 crown brands as entry passes into recursive clubs. crown brands with cheeze. crown royale.",4
Something Wild,Johnson,"I really enjoyed this moobie. I even thought through the first half I was really uncomfortable with jeff daniels being a dirtbag and I didn’t know this woman.

It was a fun fantasy that I decided to let go and so happy about the background shit with the priest and nun inexplicably at the reuinion and civil war reanactment.

ray mentioned at length.

i really really liked this, i do give it a bit more benefit of doubt for mid 80s like a different time like sometimes i give it that benefit and im inconsistent and i dont care. i really realy like this film 4 virginias for lubbers t-shirts.",4
Juwanna Mann,Johnson,"
alright so I watched this last night and ive never seen it before.

At first I was like okay, an irreferent comedy something stupid from middle school and it was and I laughed a bit.

I was like if on Sunday on tnt and im in nursin a hangover with friends this would be really fun.

i thought we would have a lot to talk about and that i missed soemthing, but no i think i saw all the funny parts.

it was silly pretty enjoyable, 2 flawless cgi titty cups.

I went first cause i wanted higher scores.",2
So I Married An Axe Murderer,Johnson,"don’t hava ton to say.

I was really excited to watch this movie. I remember seeing it in video rental stores, and I had a false memory of seeing it on comedy central.

Interesting time capsule from the 90s that was neat to see.

The beginning was kinda boring, but i did enjoy just being like "" holy shit what are these choices mike meyers is making?""

not a huge fan of him but after this movie so excited to talk to you guys about it which counts for something.

terrible subtitles with this movie.

didnt discuss the chemistry between mike and nancy... i didnt really believe that. i loved the twist at the end.

i didnt see that coming and thought it was pretty awesome.

really enjoyed this conversation.

wanted to give this just a 1. but this conversation definitely proved that there were much more reedeeeming parts.

this is getting 0 woman but 2 wooooooah mans = 2 units.",2
Pretty Woman,Johnson,"I started this movie last night and finished it today after work.

Was not having an enjoyable time last night. Really did not like it.

Usually this yuppie 90s wealthy people are sposed to be loved for being financially successful for whatever reason turns me off.

so yeah i didnt like it. so i had 30 minutes left and i turned it on and i liked it and i felt like richard gere changed and grew in those 20 minutes, becoming a human and not a psycho path.

the movie won me over and like ""oh i think i liked that""

there's plenty of reasons without julia roberts this movie stinks but she is able to elevate the entire thing.

the movie tricked me and the part at the end hes like what does the prince do and shes like ""she saves him too""

and i was like that's what this whole thing was the whole time disney gushing like a moron i was bamboozled.

hate begin, liked end. so three steamy polo divits.",3
Roman Holiday,Johnson,"after first coupla reviews waiting someone coming outta edgy review could fall behind with shags being excellent describing this movie love audry hepburn and photo in the bathroom.

Something about limitations of films shot in this era like scenes with no sound they overcome those challenges and make something enjoyable to watch that was always designed that way.

whole movie was really really wholesome and like shag it was really close to being a perfect film it challenges the audience and that's not what it was going for but that's fine i love the film so gonna give it 4 truthy hands inside a monster gods mouth.",4
Romance and Cigarettes,Johnson,"I fuckin lub romance and cigerets.

I love when film is a show. Walken fuckin ridiculous is insane. The biting the dancing the writing.

I fuckin lubbed it. Connection between a romance and a wife was difficiilt I was so fuckin bummed I missed the conversation. two from ben? what the fuck is that about.

4 cucumbers in the gardeners ass.",4
Secretary,Johnson,"
I would love to bat the cycle, but there is zero chance that im giving this a 5, because it would negate a lot of my earlier scores.

I was perplexed a ton through this.

1. it talked about self cutting. Which I don’t claim to know  a ton about.

2. bdsm which i dont claim to know a ton about.

3. it claimed it was a comedy, but now i dont know what comedy is.

but beyond that, i thought it was really clever. i loved the way maggie and james spader were acting of each other. i thought, i dunno, i thought it really worked well, they had a ton of chemistry even throughout his weirdness and quirckyness.

we touched on the movie, thought it oculda be a bit more tidy but specially towards the end i thought it was fun. and i guess i didnt take it too too seriously i thought of it all through the lense of a fantasy so i gave it a lot of leeway.

jordan: lee halloway

having said that i cant give it a 5, honestly cant give it a 4. wanna give over a 3 but cant give film 3 hairbrush spanks in hairbrush bafroom.",3
The Rocketeer,Johnson,"Daniel: this had hard matinee vibes and this was another ryan pick. You picked your lane.

Sam: it has been fun to see you show us your movie club vibes.

Jordan: sum of all it's parts. Industrial and lookin.

Ryan: I gotta get out of art deco.

Johnson back: Okay cool.

I really enjoyed this movie i feel like it got the big benefit of the doubt.

been busy like this is one the huge thing i really relazed watchin it i havent watched the last couple with a super discerning eye or critical eye but this made me watch this one with really really enjoy it.

it was like ""he was an asshole?"" and then like yeah but the negative things were going way over my ehad and didnt really notice.

i loved this 1930s lookback the wholesome in a way that uh i feel too weird being negative on with confines of hollywood thing i dunno.

loved the plane stuff was awesome been to the bulldog cafe won it huge points coulda rewrote this better (llc) there was a really cool bassist that could have made it really cool.

thank you really ryan for making it vhs cover fuckin coolest movie in the world cause outfit so fuckin cool gonna give this 4 slices of beamons chewing gum.",4
The Perfect Host,Johnson,"90 minutes is a big deal. No forget that respect.

This was about the longest 90 minute long movie ive seen in a while I paused and continuously was flummoxed at how much was left.

Watching this I enjoyed enough of it. I thought really interesting at the gate, i dont know how much the writer has figured it it out in an interesting way. we came up with all the ways this could be improved. there's definitely a kernel of what is good i was glad we had a break of a week on movie club and it faired and half of the time we were just chattin about other stuff bonkers bizzarre as movie and it just wasnt interesting enough to keep our attention to talk about.

it wasnt interesting it was weird but it wasnt interesting but kinda stunk and because of that i would give it 1 but david hyde pierce's just insanity my eyes couldnt look any place else, without him i would not even be capitivated as interested and every just naile dit with 2 cheeky lil mystery boxes.",2
Throw Momma From the Train,Johnson,"okay uh. I thought this movie was fine. I thought that it was really silly and so if I didn’t try to be to critical I enjoyed it.

Billy kristil caracter was miscast. Danny devito character was lovable in a kind of stupid idiot kinda way. Danced with too stupid.

did an okay job.

first time i heard momma speak she was gonna be hated by me but then i loved her and laughed out loud at some of the ridiculous stuff she said.

movie had tons and tons of flaws, but it was short. i never paused and was like how much time is left.

enough dumb humor to keep me engaged. not actively to have watched it too many flaws to middle of road so it falls to a 2 clumsy poops. copies of 100 women id like to pork.",2
Midnight Run,Johnson,"sure ill go.

So yeah, I enjoyed this film.

Im watching it really surprised that I never caught it before.

Was this on rotation on tnt like shawshank?

You gotta bleepin it mosta the time.

Dad told me bout midnight run but not on tv somewhere.

especially the 90s and bethovens dads career noway.

it had a lot of the qualities of the heavy rotation movies, not as a nock, but i coulda seen myself watching in the middle all the way to the end. you dont gotta put the pieces together, they will tell you which i enjoyed.

i loved the relationship between the two. i wish robert deniro had a better growth arc, maybe it did and i wanted too much. but yeah everyones super cool in this film.

i dont have anything else original to say.

im surprised with how many 4s. this coming into it feels like a solid 3 for me, so i stick to my solid guns and stick to a 3 and enjoyed the film for others but not for me. 3 non-counterfiet counterfiet 20s. thats how many the bar got to keep.",3
Hard-Boiled,Johnson,"so, I was really excited for tonight because I took 3 pages of notes, most in a long time. Long movie, a ton to look at. A lot of the times I was very confused and along for the ride. Really glad to see that jon woo spoke about this movie, and didn't really care about plot structure or creating a cohesive story.

he did what was right in the moment, and that mirrored my experience.

it was a ton of fun, was a video game movie from the 90s, didnt know much about it, it was a little long. some of the action scenes just kept going on and on and on.

i feel really stupid complaining about that, they dont make movies this bonkers, i dig it. the music was really good and so that was dope too.

im gonna go by gut this time, didnt make sense this genre was being too critical by me in my brain this wasnt sposed to be a comedy im gonna give it from my gut 4 day saving little piss pots.",4
Toys,Johnson,"clears throat.

First I agree with ryan, or I get why ryan's mom or my mom didn't want us to watch this film when I was little. Too dirty for me.

I loved what sam said about having terry gilliam doing this film, I know I mentioned the thing about the kids, the other thing is that the establishing shots at the beginning was so awesome, even the military presence is so over the top it doesn't feel like the real word, then they are like ""vietnam exists"" and maybe everywhere is like bonkers in this universe.

i love world building and this took the perfect first step and then just doesnt do anything with it.

i think pretty much everyone said just about everything that i felt.

i think that this conversation was the best thing in the movie.

too much space between the way they were conmbine di didnt really dig talking about them made me laugh a lot.

so heay that s all i got i didn thate this movie as much as i thought i would once it started.

i think its overall creativity wins it a ton of points.

3 peas and carrots in a problematic pea pile.

i do have problems with infantile characters having unprotected sex",3
The Last Emporer,Johnson,"I agree, awesome pick reif for first epic selection. This one felt shorter than a lot of the othe rmovies that were significantly shorter in run time.

The fact that it was based on a real event, that brought something new to movie club that we havent had in a long time.

that was a blast to discuss and lots of fun things to think about.

the movie was pretty, the writing was kind of whatever.

i was fascinated by the overall story that fascinated me.

need to read some articles and stuff.

right inbetween two for me. but im definitely gonna remember this one positively so gonna give this one 4 turds in a bowl.",4
Strange Brew,Johnson,"
from the very get of this film uh it screamed at me ""this is a cult film that somehow slipped unner the radar""

I coulda believe I even had passing it - thanks hake I think canadian humor is like kids in the hall.

Yeah the hoser shit got kinda old and there's so much of it that kinda got funny again which I kinda enjoyed.

Moranais and Thomas really executed it really well here.

What else do I have to say about Hake.

I was like ""I hope he's big when he's a kid and not finding that sweet piece of hidden art that was important to him"" so I kinda believe him.

So yeah, it wasn't a great feat of a cinematic whatever, but it's definitely a high 3 two minute pisses on a looney bin.",3
Equilibrium,Johnson,"
thank you reif for bringing this up.

Last time we saw this was in reif's basement when we were 16 or 17. especially that first one in the dark going super crazy, iconic in my brain.

I always remembered it being really entertaining and really good.

now that i had the chance to watch it i was like, eh maybe it shoulda stayed in my brain where i thought it was.

i think it tries to be more entertaining than it executes.

honestly i think that's okay.

i wanted to know more about the world. i love that dystopian weird thing.

i think this coulda been a miniseries now and done really well instead of this movie.

so yeah.

uh..

when reif picked it last week i was like oooh sweet i get to give something a 5.

dont think that's right however i enjoyed this one dont need to be rational this gets 4 taye diggss faces on a marble floor.",4
The Natural,Johnson,"I feel like for as long as ive known sam, he's recommended this film to me. If I was gonna be a honest I probably still have his dvd somewhere that he loaned to me at my parents house.

The part that while im mildely ashamed of not returning it, im more ashamed of having it over a decade and havent watched it til now.

i thought it was good. i was worried it was too good but there was a ton to talk about it we touched on magical realism i m here for full magic if we coulda bumped anything up bump that.

but no uh everything else mostly been said the cast was pretty cool i loved the vibe of the film it was super general.

ths is an easy pick of 4 poisonous morsel tartlets.",4
Little Shop of Horrors,Johnson,"I can go next.

Yeah I hadnt seen this movie in a really long time since I was a littl eone.

This was a delight to watch. I have a softspot for musicals.

The songs were much better than I remember them being.

Loved the performance and just how absurd it was.

i was in the perfect mood to enjoy just how absurd it was.

been a while i give this score but im gonna give 5 glitter lilly funeral arrangements.",5
Uncle Buck,Johnson,"
*nice*

I love this movie.

I think its crazy quotable.

I was really excited to have all yalls watch it.

Kinda  a bummer we ddint get to watch this all together.

Megs had seen this in pieces like how you watch it on tv.

So I sat on the floor in front of her and was looking at her and sayin ""watch you think about that"" and i was really annoying her all the time.

then i was like worried and nervous cause i love this movie and if my friends dont love this movie what if they think its bad and theres something i didnt see.

it was a great watch and added to a different level of excitement to the whole thing.

my kid brain filled in the holes that my adult brain didnt have and there was some issues with that and the dialogue was great

loved john candy talkin to maisy and miles and the innocence of their responses to his kinda goofballish kinda dopey adulthood i really love that.

it was kinda wholesome and held up to me.
so yeah this remains one of my favoirte movies this is a totally unsurprising 5 gnat circumcising hatchets.",5
Office Space,Johnson,"cool.

So when shag picked this one I was pumped to get a chance to re-watch this film that I knew I had seen it in the past.

When I watched it I didn’t realize how many scenes I had seen I had seen this a shitton, I memorized many scenes.

culturally this movie was huge, changed my perspective more than most films in general.

the one bummer was that i was hoping for more scenes that i had forgotten (not a knock on this film) its excellent really really good.

dont have much to say about it always fun to watch 4 bobs.",4
The Karate Kid,Johnson,"has a quick one he supposes.

Was excited to watch this movie when it came out.

The fight scenes held up a lot. If I was anywhere near jaden smiths age when this comes out I woulda been a real hype on it for sure.

Current johnson loved jackie chan, he's killing it in this role and bringing sweetness and care.

jaden smith seems like a weirdo in real life crushes this role, girl character is unnecessary kinda makes it weird.

she doesnt really work. the bad kid works great tho, really enjoyed that.

so yeah my biggest and only criticism of the film is its length. its too long and it kinda drags.

thats my only criticism, other than that the movie fuckin crushes.

thanks for bringing us back to this jord, gonna give 4 jackets up with attitude.",4
Jupiter Ascending (re-view),Johnson,"so I do feel like going into this movie with basement level expectations does this movie better.

Certain things I really liked about it. I think there is a kernel of a story in here that is good.

I liked the aesthetic choice of gothic space ships - really cool all the gothic architecture, eddy redmayne making choices really great, i dont think that mila kunis can act and channing tatum stinks. they named the one elephant character ""nesh"" reference to indian god is fucking stupid.

the watchowskis were shooting for a space opera epic and it just came off muddy.

we just mentioned earlier that the matrix was crisp and in this every action scene was crazy blurry and hard to watch.

once again absolutely loved the conversation super stinky pile of shit movie i give this a 1 space rollerblades.",1
Dhoom,Johnson,"I'm glad that I got to bring bollywood to mnc, I was really hoping to bring something new and fresh.

I think I did that .

The conversation was way more positive than I thought it would be.

This movie took me 3 nights to view because the baby.

The movie was a slog. These little pockets, reif mentioned erlier, that i was laughing - a lot.

The fact that this was a subtitle movie, meant you had to stay much more engaged than an english speaking movie that made it a little bit more arduous.

It had the tropes that... and the song and dance numbers were way to long but it was fun to have it.

i definitely enjoyed watching something that is outside my wheelhouse.

im glad that it was so kooky and bonkers

while this was not tremendously good, it was really fun and i enjoyed something that was totally bonkers new.

this is getting a 3 removed glasses. and i will put it in my review. This one will be one that we reference and mention way more in the future.

our low scores will probably be in it. ",3
Inu-Oh,Johnson,"so I liked it for all the reasons we alreadysaid. I thought it was subtle.

Or supple?

I like the japanese culture, so fun to play with. Love the animation style.

My biggest gripe, happened a lot in this film, is that they reused animation over and over, such as dancing. exact same loops and then they come right back to it.

theres this one where he does this weird flip thing with his leg, and after i seen it the 15th time, it pulled me out of the film when they reuse the same thing over and over and over.

personal gripe, whatever didnt like it.

overall the conversation of this film prvoed that this was a great movie club pick that will sit in my brain for long long time

3 cursed elongated arms.",3
Super Mario Bros.,Johnson,"I don’t know if it was them not wanting to watch something about video games or what but they knew it was bad.

I could shit on this movie, but it does take swings.

I was excited because ryan picked this one. It had nostalgia that I got to see. it was a total mess of a movie.

it felt like cocaine and money thrown at the wall.

dont have a whole lot more to say about it.

i did fall asleep twice watching it.

for that i give this 2 screamin martini worms.",2
We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story,Johnson,"alright.

So I remember this movie somhow kinda coming out. I pretty sure I saw this movie I ntheaters, but my parents don’t remember so maybe it’s a false memory.

The first thing I read about this movie before watching it was that it was a childrens book.

this skewed how i interpreted this film. watching childrens books its snappy you gotta move place to place, who gives a shit about plotholes we trying to get to the end.

i forgave a lot of its shortcomings, of course the demolition explosion blast them into central park where they are supposed to go.

end was pretty intense for a little kid. enjoyed it, but was it a good movie? absolutely not. i dont score based on awards, accolates, critic approval, this is nothing lower than 4 circuses with a notion of spice.",4
Blood Simple,Johnson,"I don’t know who the cohen brothers are, but I did hear about them one time.

I really loved the vibe all the way through. I didn't think it was boring.

I agree with the criticisms and I see them, but I didn’t notice them when I was watching it. the film did that for me.

i like these kinds of movies where it's confusion between characters adds compounds and creates solutions to conflict.

i really liked it so it gets 4 windowless curtains from me.",4
Gattaca,Johnson,"this film, I thought, was - I guesss I came into this with high expectations - but I though this was booooring.

Unbelievable boring.

The acting lacked passion. And I just could not connect to the 1950s version of the future at all

I thought it was stupid.

yeah i dunno i just.. i didn't connect with this movie for whatever reason and i didn't enjoy it

this gets a 1 chickenshitunmichaelphelpslike swimmy bois.
",1
Every Which Way But Loose,Johnson,"I entered this movie not realizing it was a comedy. And Clint Eastwood went in not realizing this was a comedy. So that was a little weird.

For movie night club, yes it was too long but there was just enough absurdity that I was getting really excited to go and talk about it with you guys.

It ticked a lot of the boxes that I like to tick for a movie night club movie.

i was not upset to watch this film, but i wont watch the sequel.

I will rate this 3 pissen, shittin, fartin and ass pickens.",3

Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,Ryan,"I feel like I have to clairify something, so, I didn't necesarily say this was my favorite representation of batman, but this is the most acurate portrayal of the batman I read about and batman lore. I think this is the only feature film of batman where he doesn't murder anyone. Which to me is a very intergral basic tenent of batman. This is the only batman film about trama and really gets into the pathos and reasoning that compels him to do what he does. Even the Nolan films doesn't get into the tortured things that compel him to stop if he wants to stop. Ultimately he finds happiness and in this he can't. There's no happy ending for him. This gets to the tragic core in 76 minutes that Nolan couldn't. There is something isolated and pure about this one. It has a special place in my heart. 4 Batarangs.

Victor/Victoria,Ryan,"number 1 I want to thank elysia. Number 2 I want to thank you for inviting me.

It was a delight, in the good ways it reminded me of all that jazz and caberet. I like musicals for the most part with exceptions like the sound of music, sorry julie andrews fans.

my quick review i dont have much to say that hasnt been said. first hour is 4 stars. second hour is 2 stars. so im gonna give it 3 stars. 3 of norma's small rages. norma's small rages are a big part of why the first part is a 4 star.",3
Drop Dead Gorgeous,Ryan,"I said this earlier, but I feel like talking to everybody I wish I had someone in the room while I watched this.

On the one hand you have this stacked cast of amazing incredible performers. On the other hand you have this just, hateful, mean spirited thing to me. It had early 2000s family guy vibes, which was a tough hang for me. i zoned out a little bit, i got mad a little bit...

i was not into it, and then hearing you guys talking about it i felt like i was watching a totally different movie.

i think i'm just 20 years late to the game. that said, im gonna have to go with 2 seared beercanhands.",2
The American Astronaut,Ryan,"the movie reminded me of 2 things that arent movies. Wait. Wait. I am disappointed that I couldn’t bring up the talking point what is the weirdest thing you’ve ever heard while shitting in a public restroom,.

Reminded me of something projected on the wall in an art museum.

something non linear, no plot or narrative to it, just visually interesting, if you sit on the bench and are patient it will pay off.

and old 1800s and 1900s parlour stories where the characters are sitting around and telling stories and it shifts based on what the people say like the turn of the screw.

first 30 minutes into it

second 30 minutes kinda

last 30 minutes fell off the cliff.

overall very glad that i know this exists, glad i watched it, would watch again, so ill probably go with 4 cigarrettes.",4
Bones,Ryan,"*cross talk*

wait a second. I okay, there was something magical about this movie that made 2001 seem like it was 50 years ago, and I appreciated that.

However, it was kinda a bummer that I checked the time, the first time anything happened was 1 hour and 1 minutes into the movie and that was a bit of a drag.

snoop was well cast in the flashbacks. happy to see pam greer pop up. the final 20 minutes were a fun ride.

the movie reached for some sort of social commentary and it just wasnt able to quite grasp it unfortunately.

im gonna have to go with 2 spooky maggot rain-houses as well.",2
Zombi 2 (Zombie Flesh-Eaters),Ryan,"well, I felt like this movie was 30 minutes longer than I had patience for. There was a good 20 minute chunk in the 3rd act where I completely checked out. The molotov cocktails part.

Um, it grabbed my attention again in the closing moments with the surprise twist ending about new york. i dont think it was a twist ending or that much of a surprise if you relaly think about it but th emovie numbed my mind so much that i had completely forgot.

have to give credit for making my jaw drop at the end.

overall movie i want to give 1 star to, but scenes like ""zombie vs shark"" and ""eye penetration"" and certain other key moments of the movie that will be in my head forever, i want to give those parts 5 stars. overall i have to this 3 tits out scooba divers.",3
Tales From the Crypt Presents: Bordello of Blood,Ryan,"I recognize that I was exceptionally quiet during tonights call, because I had nothing to say about this movie. There was nothing to muse on and reflect on, I fell asleep during it and I had to rewind and rewatch it again, and I still forgot everything that happeend. i found nothing redeeming about it and i hate dennis miller a lot and i dont understand why he has a career and what the

its good to know that zero is an option in the future.",1
Possession,Ryan,"we were put in a unique situation where we had to watch this movie 2 times in 1 month. I would say that a month is long enough to digest.

Yeah Ill go ill go.

The first time I saw this, was maybe partially soley by jackasses sitting near us.

My main takeaway the first time i was really angry. i agree with johnson, i was mad at the characters and wanted them to shut the fuck up because they were screaming for 2 hours.

i wanted to get away from it because of the din and the noise assult.

now i realize, im supposed to feel that way, its supposed to make me sweat and tug on my collar and it was very successful on that goal.

this movie does for me for marriage wat psyco does for showers and jaws does to the beach.

i feel like it gestated in my head pretty well for the past 6 weeks. it was kind of a nice payoff to watch again now. im gonna give it 3 trashcan feathers.

if i waited 10 years maybe ill give 5 but for now 3 is the number.",3
Misery,Ryan,"*laughs*

okay so, this is, a, this films like a masterwork in tapping into whatever visceral aversion and disgust I have with the idea of being helpless and at someone's mercy.

Someone mentioned earlier the rosemary's baby, like roe in that movie is completely helpless and whatever peoples kindness and james caan is at kathy bates kindness that turns out to be something else and he's confined to whatever she decides is best for him.

that's just horrifying, especially in this movie. there may be something to my reaction now on the phsycological level of being imprisoned to write something about what you dont give a shit about for th erest of your life but i wont get into that right now.

this movie is paced so well and most of it takes place in 1 room but you don't spend any boredome you want to sepnd more time to see the rooms and corners of the house kept hidden.

in a pacing term, any time i was getting too tense and i cant stand this anymore we got a BUSTER BREAK, which we shoulda named this movie out of. the richard farnswerth scenes were perfect levity for too much to stand.

okay. with all that said, i yeah. i agree that the michael meyers momenet at the end was hamfisted but even with that i gotta give 5 bitchly cow corns.",5
Someone's Watching Me!,Ryan,"this was pretty good for a 1970s made for tv movie but that isnt saying very much.

Phantom of the Paradise,Ryan,"I, this is the worst kind of review to give because if eel like I don’t hate it and I don’t love it. While I was watching it I felt like I was alluding to what jordan was feeling: antsy and rolling my eyes.

Today I listened to the music and the closing credits was like ""your bad in bed so your better off dead"" just letting it stir in my brain and the cult status about it and what is enduring about it rose it in my estimation a bit.

i hate to be boring im right in the the middle here 3 beef for me.",3
The Lady From Shanghai,Ryan,"mad with a lot of chewin away at my own self.

Guys! I loved this shit! This is my jam. I really like this kinda story telling. I really like uh, daschell hammet and raymond chandler books.

This is good stuff for me.

Yes, courtroom scene. I love all of the weird interjections of the peanut gallery, like the weird extras.

goober pile looking guy with his shirt tucked into his under pants that walks around and shouts ""hey mike, mike!"" the whole movie.

yeah yeah, its good stuff.

yeah im into it. this is for me.

i found my 2009 college paper about this movie.

i will close my review with an exerpt from that.

""Rita Hellworths---hellworth's Elsa is portrayed as weak earlyon in the movie. in contrast with michael the tough guy, however the true edgy nature comes through. elsa repeatedly asks michael for help to be damsel in distress as if she cant do things without the aid of a man.

put on bathrobe. put on coat on deck. immediately after she needs ohara's help with simple task of coat - shet akes control of ship and steers it. she has taken control of their relationship!""

Anyway. im gonna give this 4 sweaty excitable grisbees.",4
Naked Lunch,Ryan,"in the immortal words of nelson muntz ""I can think of at least 2 things wrong with that title""

they thouht they were gonna see sex at a picnic and they got bugs and typewriters turning into dicks

I hate beatnicks and howl and gins and editing yourself as a sin and put down the first thing on the page.

HOWEVER i love david cronenburg. what he made here is like a biography of a really intersting public figure mixed with drug addled hallucinations overshadowing his life and carerr.

the practical effects in this movie were just amazing. i was really enthralled anytime there was a puppet anytime on screen.

it touched on something in my 21 year old brain of like, thinking it was fun to explor movies that did weird shit that most movies dont do, digging through the stacks at the library or half priced books to find classic literature that was subversive or fucked up.

i really gotta kick out of it. felt like i was watching something 15 years ago and being excited by it and mezmerized like ""oh movies can do this?""

so i liked it. i give it 4 sips of mugwump jism.

Go,Ryan,"ill make it quick

as someone who had no fun in his late teens and early 20s. This felt like something that was created and written by other people who had no funs trying to guess what it musta been like to go to a rave when you are 17 years old.

it just felt like a facsimilie or invitation of the idea of being cool in la doing drugs and going to clubs and stuff

like an imitation of tarantino or kids and stuff like that. it kinda came across to me as kinda safe late 90s things - shes all that, cant hardly wait,

shaggy: ""you are speaking my vibes buddy""

not dangerous

yeah i was like trying to joke and compare to family circus and connect to todd and family circus with sunday funnies but i couldnt figure out a way to bring that in but i will give this 2 crunchy herbal raves shits",2
Riders of Justice,Ryan,"I had the advantage of having seen it a few months ago so I could come into this without a sense of discovery, but rather a reevaulation.

I really respect and appreciate the character work in this movie. I think its really fun to watch all these people come to gether in the way that they do.

its not like a version of this movie that would be really awful and cringeworthy where you examine these damaged men seeking revenge fors omething that doesnt need avenging.

instead it takes these people and this idea this notion of chaos and nothing matters, the random acts of the universe, and spends something a little more sympatheic about it and these people are able to navigate the chaos and randomness of the universe together.

even though they do fucking horrendous things together and do french horn.

nuance to it. not just nialistic dopey going ons then i first realized i appreciate the work that went inna movie.

imma give 4 chubby salamis.

Broadcast News,Ryan,"first of all im surprised we arent rating this based on professionally laundered shirt boxes that look like donuts.

But the screwdrivers is good too.

I think I watched this movie in 2006, like my first semester of college and I thought it might like it more now that im older but... i feel like the characters even thought they are more my age like, they act like little fuckin babies.

i was confused about how hold they were supposed to be cause they acted like they were in their 20s but looked like in their 30s.

it was uncomfortable and offputting. relationships and love triangle was the movie but it iddnt have a point of view about journalism integrity and objective reporting i dont thin kit really had a strong stance on that it doubled down on.

more like kind of a petty immature horny office culture that it was showing.

i was trying to wanted to bring this up in the conversation and neve really got into it did you want jane to end up with one of the guys or other.

biggest win is that nobdoy ended up together, that's a huge positive for the screeplay, because none of them belonged together or were good wfor each other.

i felt a bit annoyed throughout the movie with the characters and wanted to have a more point of view about th esetting or culture that it took place in but it didnt and that really bummed me out.

all i have to say it amountes to 2 screwdrivesr from concentrate for me.",2
Matinee,Ryan,"I had this movie in my back pocket for a while and I was saving it for a movie club opportunity.

As I was watching it actively I had kind of a visceral disappointment reaction to it.

I was a little irritated that it wasn’t living up to some sort of preconcieved idea about what it was gonna be knowing joe dante directed it.

i guess i wanted the movie to be a little more out there and cooky, like more ascerbic and bitter, and then the next day after watching it i realized that's not what they were going for at all, more of a nostailgiac trip down memry lane as movie fans and 12 year olds.

my assessment of it was unfair as i came to realize.

with all that said,  thought about some themes and jokes, talkin to you guys.

i think there were certain things, the score first and foremose, that score sort of deflated the best things about the movie.

so taking the jerry goldsmith outta it. i will hate to say it... will give 3 shopping cart uncles middle of the road movie.",3
Playtime,Ryan,"technically and in terms of craft, it should be a 5 crowned brands movie, however I felt like it was asking way too much of me as a viewer.

It was like an every frame of the movie was a wheres waldo or i-spy, it was work.

So, the effort and craft went into it were 5 crowned brands but i ended up walking away that it was a 3 crowned brands movie because i felt like i ran a mental marathon by the end of it.

as impressive and overwhelmingly well put together as it was..",3
Something Wild,Ryan,"I actually was, before I picked matinee, this was on the short list of movies for movie club, because I remember watching it in my class and liking it.

Spoilers, I still liked it.

Watching it I really enjoyed kinda going along for the ride with the characters and thinking about how stressed out or uncomfortable i would be in their shoes, which is not my idea of romance.

but i thought it was really interesting to see through their eyes. didnt remember it all. thinking jeff daniels was being such a piece of shit, but then the turn appreciated.

interest in audrey was not enough for me. thats my major nitpick with it. all that said, its a really fun ride johnathan dimmy rules, feelies was great, ray liotaa explode on screen 4 virginia for lubber t-shirtsaswell.

ray liota explody as good phrase.",4
Juwanna Mann,Ryan,"
um.

Misses doubtfire this aint.

I kept thinking about how in that movie they had a narrative device to explain why robin williams character was able to successfully pull off and convince people he was a woman.

In this they made no attempt, just a bit of shitty blush and no awareness of ridiculousness of that. so lazy nothing good to say about this im giving it 1 flawless cgi titty cup. thats all i can give.",1
So I Married An Axe Murderer,Ryan,"
this movie was very quizziting. I felt like I had never seen this movie before, but watching it still gave me the feeling of ""oh I liked this movie when I was nine and I feel embarrassed that I liked it when I was nine""

everything to be said about mike meyers and his tim robbins haircut was annoying. couldnt see a character fall in love with.

movie is called ""so i married an axe murderer"" but he didnt marry an axe murderer. it doesnt deliver on it's promise.

the cameos phil hartman and other guy were great rest in peace fellas.

0 womans and 2 wooooomans = 2 units.",2
Pretty Woman,Ryan,"I read last night a bit about the making of this movie, and there was something about how richard gere's performancing in this movie was pretty wooden and monotone and gary mashall explained in interviews that he gave richard gere the direction to play it that way to give julia roberts the opportunity to shine and not have a competitng presense with her.

i dont think i know better than gary marshell but i think that was a dumb decisions cause vivian falls in love with edward doesnt make sense hes awful in every way there's nothing that makes me see why she would like to go off with him at the end of this film i dont get it at all.

i have been getting texted by my boss this entire call and getting in trouble through work, im feeling very despondent and grumpy.

so well all that to say my world view is very negative right now i dont believe in love, i dont believe in this movie two steaming polo divits that is tempered with how i am feeling in this exact moment in time.",2
Roman Holiday,Ryan,"I can go next.

I don’t have a ton to say about this movie, which is a symptom for when a movie is objectively good in these conversations.

But I do echo a lot of what sam said, I will add to that into the long storied histroy of editories in cheif in movies and this one has a good one and i really liked him.

second only to audry hepburn, never seen her now i get it really enjoyed her 4 turthy hands inside a demon gods throat mouth mouth.",4
Romance and Cigarettes,Ryan,"filmmaker has to say:

finally I can talk about this movie that I made.

Yeah. Watching this movie I had this feeling that there's probably a german word for I don’t know. Its not second hand embarrassment… its like second hand vulnerability.

It just felt really, i felt very tender about john turturo opening up and exposing raw nerves. it was borderline uncomfortable in a lot of ways but also really sweet and dopey and earnest and endearing.

cause its just like, this guy is old enough to be my dad pouring his heart out into this weird fucking art who i could not imagine someone i know being unashamed to put something out there.

it was really funny too. there's a really interesting thing going on with a drama wher eyou want the actors to disappear into the role but instead it's stacked from top to bottom with people you know and thats a choice i appreciated.

the ending i had to rewatch cause i spaced out at the end and that was a raw nerve exposed on john tuturo and so dorky show everyone what's in your heart kinda thing.

i think specially after this discussion im feeling 4 cucumbers in a gardeners ass.",4
Secretary,Ryan,"watching this movie made me feel like that praralegal taking a shit and the next stall over she could hear secretary lee masturbating.

I was confused at what was going on and not sure if it was supposed to be hot or not.

Similar to hake, what I knew of this movie was an interview with conan obrien and showing the clip of him making her bend over the desk and smacking her butt.

i thought it was funnier than you guys thought this was. it seemed to be more intentionally going for a laugh in a lot of places compared to how the conversation acknowledged.

i think the two leads did a great job, disagreed with some of the script choices, my overall takeaway of it was that i was not like checking my watch. i liked this movie more than pretty woman so i gotta give 3 hairbrush spanks in the bathroom.",3
The Rocketeer,Ryan,"some of my favorite quotes from this movie:

""I've had a belly fulla your cheap heroics.""

I liked uh:

""flyboy hangs one my kisser and you let him waltz!""

I have one more, and I can't find it now:

""We've searched this place, from hell to breakfast""

My personal favorite:

""Yeah! That's what I said! A rocket Man!

Everything's kinda been said over the past couple hours and during these reviews.

I really enjoyed these kind of neville trying to seduce jenny and she being like ""yeah that's from this movie""

and then the celebrity cameos was like hail ceasar and the old timey reporters ""talkin like this!"" and i really enjoyed that and felt the wholesomness of it and give it 4 slices of beamon's pepsin gum!

jordan: wow you really nailed it.",4
The Perfect Host,Ryan,"first of all I want to do know why johnson is drawring a pictuare of me hey did you guys know that romanians had red teeth and eat red meat. I think this movie has a good shot at winning a few jupies. It feels like a movie I woulda bougt sight unseen at walmart, dvd land.

i dont know this was uh
rough for me. i wish it
woulda just committed
to being a thing. It cou
lda been good if it
just admitted it was
funny as a comedy
if it just commited
to being creepy or
a disturbing comedy
it oculda been kinda good
it felt like poeple who were
making it just really wanted 
to make amovie but didnt
have an idea or a stroy they
were passionate about. i dunno

but i did get to see david hyde

Throw Momma From the Train,Ryan,"The first two acts of this movie, if I had written them, I would be sooo pleased with myself. So proud.

I would do a friend table reading to show my crazy ideas.

The chicken's out a little bit because the axe murderer and nobody throws momma from a train.

i really liked danny devito in this movie. i liked the whole angle about being about writers. I was a mark for that, it worked on me.

i had never seen this before... alysia talking about it seems like something i woulda watche dover and over again as a kid if i knew or exposed to it.

maybe its the connection to other childhood movies i had with some of the performers and other stuff.

it tickled me. i liked it a lot. other than it chickens out at the end and wasnt as dark as it needed.

that was not enough of a gripe to give it 4 copies of mr guys 100 girls i'd like to pork.",4
Midnight Run,Ryan,"I watched this movie a long time ago, I was a diffrnt man then. Uh, but uh, from what I can remember, I really liked it.

I will add to what sam said and I have a note here, that there's something I distinctly remember.

Grodin that they wrote about grodin coulda been robin williams going over the top playing it for th eback oft he room and they went with grodin instead and i kept expecting him to jump up screaming and being a level 11 and he just remained charles grodin and that was really special and cool to me.

unlike the last movie we watched, someone got thrown from a train.

and uh. i yeah.

this is a movie you show freshmen in screenwriting 101 class. how you break a story beat for beat, tell a narrative through film Im gonna give it 4 non-counterfiet counterfiet 20s.",4
Hard-Boiled,Ryan,"I did not wait to go for dramatic effect. It didn’t make me angry, but now I feel this is going to be not that interesting or climactic to the second to last review.

Everybody said everything and it’s a perfect movie club movie its everything everyone is after and has iconic moments that will pop up randomly in my head forever.

why the hell is this movie only on youtube the only way a human can consume this film.

This movie is for the people.

i just think its a shame.

might be worth $70 for the dvd. Just get criterion to make a blue ray.

for me its probably like 15 minutes too long to get a 5 star rating so im gonna do 4 day saving little piss pots tonight.",4
Toys,Ryan,"ill try to be fast.

Im gonna call my mom tomorrow and thank her for not letting me watch this movie when I was a kid.

I cant think of the last time that I turned against a movie so quickly, that fucking christmas carol bulllshit made me hate this movie in the first 90 seconds.

you need to lose that stuff, it has nothing to do with the movie and it soured my whole vibe.

theres really cool set design, interesting ideas, ll cooljay, michael gambon killing it.

but ultimately berry levinson saw brazil and was like ""im gonna do that""

it made me fee frustrated and bummed out for specifically ll cooljay. I was like im sorry man, you worked really hard and did such an incredible job and yet it was this.

because my heart hurts for LL CoolJay I have to give this movie 1 pea and carrot in a problematic puke pile.",1
The Last Emporer,Ryan,"I think I told sam that iw as planning to split this movie up into two nights and never did that. I endd up staying up relaly late to finish it.

I enjoyed this a lot it got me thiniking about things I don’t' really think about. When I started talking about crickets, i realized im more into animall kingdom and biology and the historical relevance and the conversation.

this was one of the more engrossing conversations Ive had about a movie and this adds a lot of clout to the movie in my mind. i didnt have the trouble with the second half as you ahd, it becoming dour and gloomy was just representative to what happened.

i was invested to the end.

soooo im gonna urinated on the side of the bowl be curteous god!

so uh 4 turds in the bowl from a piss joke to a shit joke.",4
Strange Brew,Ryan,"There is an alternate universe somewhere where a bunch of SCTV people where different characters in that.

This reminded me of all those like… waynes world and superstar, that feeling of strain designed to stretch characters out into a feature, and there is also that underlying charm where at least the comedians really love their character, and there's some quality to it where you feel endeared to the whole project because the leading actors are performers in it also.

I dont have a lot to say about it that we havent already said, it's like the kind of movie that you cover in 2 hours. While I and most of us loved rock morainis, he also loved dave thomas growing up which i feel like revealed a lot.

Anyway. 3 out of 5 2 minute pisses in a loony bin.",3
Equilibrium,Ryan,"alright ill jump in.

This is a good example of a movie that couldn’t have happened if 9/11 hadnt happened.

Its very reactionary to the state of public emotion and the feeling that was going on in media in the 5 years after that.

Its gonna sit high on that list of movies that are like, yeah this is a relic of that time.

i kept wishing that this movie was more invested in showing us a world where there was almost a utopia happening at the expense of human emotion, so that there was some sort of conflict of choosing something at.

there's no stakes like yeah topple this fuckin regime it fuckin sucks, then i realized that i was not supposed to think about it that hard.

its supposed to be cool to 17 year olds in 2003, so then that head space made it work.

so i had a lot of fun watching it and it was more than i had in the sense something i could have watched with all of you guys.

so when i give it 2 taye diggs faces on a marble floor, know that its not coming from a place that i didnt have fun with it, it does.",2
The Natural,Ryan,"dustin checks in.

Ive been putting this off. This is like still I gotta gow ith my gut. I cant believe they made the simpsons episode ""homer at the bat"" into a feature length film.

Whole time I watchin this I was picturing sam at 6-7 years old being enthralled by it.

its so adult, theres not much whimsy to grasp on to as a kid. then i tried to think about what is my equivalent to that.

a lot can pass over you as a kid if you have something to hook your brain into for me it was th ebaseball.

im not a mark for sports movies necessarily its not a surefire thing im not completely sold on it.

the best parts of this movie were the baseball parts for sure.

everything inbetween was kinda a slog for me if it wasnt baseball or wilford brimley.

it took me 4 hours to watch because of all the non baseball parts. like why did the lady shoot and why was robert redford so old.

im glad i saw this but it did not win me over like it did you guys and i feel bad about it. i wanted more base ball more magical realism and 30 minutes less movie.

im gonna give it 2 poison little morsel tartlets!

im happy i seen it and its objectively a good movie.",2
Little Shop of Horrors,Ryan,"I was trying to think of a way to sing.

I've given you batman.

I've given you mant!

Looks like you're not happy. Unless it's a plant!

I don't give a free
pass to musicals.

I think most musicals are shit.

Uncle Buck,Ryan,"shags favorite woody allen movie is ants.

Ill go. I will say.. I would like to revisit antz, I havent seen it since 7th grade. (ill pick it 'ben')

followed by bee movie.

Horny bees.

Okay ill go ahead and go.

Johnson your reasoning for picking this movie really resonated wiht me because my dad doesnt really care about many movies other than jeremiah johnson and dances with wolves, but i never got to see it growing up.

it my head it was always a steve felton movie.

i felt sentimental about it having never seen it.

all the marketing around the movie and the way the characters think about buck is that hes a complete piece of shit - transformation from terrible person to redemptive arc family man who cares about his nices and nephews.... but no. it was like he was shut out of a family life he actually did care about and john candy was perfect for that role.

hes not gross. hes not a shithead. you are cheering for him and i lvoe that.

its not flawless. but and i have talked about a lot of the hiccups and things that diddnt age well but, it did just kinda i kinda was able to be wrapped up in it pretty easily and getting by on the charm of it alone and what i had built up in this movie in my head i was in a cozy spot, so i give it 4 gnat circumcising hatchets.

",4
Office Space,Ryan,"this movie, office space, rules. I think it's been said. Makes me want to dance with two of my coworkers in a shitty apartment over hiphop music.

Ive only seen it 2 other times since this viewing, 2 years ago I watched my parents watch it on christmas - my dad sleeps through everything and he stayed awake the whole time - must be at minimum a 4 bob movie to keep dad felton awake.",4
The Karate Kid,Ryan,"I cant believe we got through this whole night without talking about the firey cup.

We didn’t talk about firey cup.

*cross talk about fire on tummy and hands burning green*

dang.

I just had to get that in there. Because it was my last shot

this was like uh. it had a lot of charm i think i made a reference to it. kind of felt like jaden and some of the other child stars had a quality to their performances and the writing behind it felt like something froma  decade earlier and before, but it had some of the prat falls of movies from 2010ish where it looked like it was shot and edited from 2010, had the runtime of a 2010 movie.

had baggages and everyone touched on that.

the moment i pressed play i knew it was gonna end on a freze frame and it ended on a freeze frame so im gonna give it 3 jackets up with attitude.",3
Jupiter Ascending (re-view),Ryan,"im gonna be succinct too. Been beautiful how pithy you all have been. Of all the watchowski movies that explain away everyday minutia as some kind of science fiction phenomenon and end with the main characters flying away.

This is definitly the worst. Im gonna disagree with mila and say that more money coulda save this and give it 1 space roller blade.",1
Dhoom,Ryan,"*in a souther twang*
This movie was a real doom!

Let me tell you, I always say, a man can be anything except a police man. What can I say, they are just so stuipd. I cant tell you how stuipd they are.

I think it has been evident in this conversation, this was kind of a tough hang. This had some real ""from justin to kelly"" vibes.

I struggled in the last hour. I forgotten a lot of the last hour. Im sorry.

But I did hang in there and I did watch it in one sitting. That's why I forgot.

All in all, I'm gonna have to land on 2 removed glasses all told.",2
Inu-Oh,Ryan,"if you had shown me a still image of inu-oh in long arm form and played one of the rock songs for me, I would have immediately given it a 5.

I watched the entire thing, and especially in first 20 minutes had hard time following the plot.

The constant leaps forward in time made it difficult to follow.

once it became a concert film like woodstock or something, i was fully in, the animation is next level. i love hand drawn animation, i love the character designs, inu-oh's long arm was awesome. I listened to the soundtrack today twice while working.

i liked it a lot.

so... it only jumped down 1 star for all the troubles i described, 4 cursed elongated arms for me.",4
Super Mario Bros.,Ryan,"with this one I've considered the gamut. Every end of the spectrum.

For my birthday I really want a poster of the koopa kissing that baby.

I also didn’t get a chance to show everyone my issues of my 7th grade comics.

Shows comics.

So that will tell you that i have an adolescent affienity for this stuff.

I have this uh, inexplicable fascination with this move because ive only seen it one time since i saw it for movie club second time.

been listening to podscasts with what went wrong and different things that never came to be. i just had a weird investment and or interest in it and when i was 5 super mario bros was the shit and the happy meals that came out.

but watching it again for this event, i had a lot of thoughts about it, i had a lot to say about it, i was really fired up about how i tried to write a movie when i was in 6th grade and it maybe was better than this one i dont know...

but uh, i can't, i can't extricate the badness of this movie with my fascination with it.

it was very entertaining to me and i was very sucked into it and sucked into the world and admiring some of the set design and the animitronics and swing for the fences performances like fiona shaw.

i think if you called it something other than super mario brothers.

really interesting, kids movie with kinky stuff going on and anti cop stuff and i dunno its just a really interesting little relic of 90s hollywood like how did this happen, so after much consideration im gonna give it 4 screaming martini worms.

",4
We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story,Ryan,"well.

Ill try and be short.

I will review this through the pointed view of the last time I saw it when I was 6 years old.

My dad took me to see jurrasic park and I wasn’t even scared. It was so awesome and cool and good.

Then I saw we're back a dinosaurs story and it was way scarier. professor screw eyes was very scary and gave me bad dreams.

2 circuses which are a notion with some spiiiice.",2
Blood Simple,Ryan,"I'm sad that I couldn’t see my 2009 review of this movie. Sam and jordan have my number.

I lapped this up like a glass of hot milk on a summer evening.

Its really really fun for me to watch this and try to parse all of the influences and origins of these filmmakers and think about their collaberation with barry sonnenfeld and sam raimie and piece all of that together.

i dunno i find this to be areally riveting southern greasy, sweaty, nasty comedy of errors and i... i really dig it. I'm into it. This gets 5 curtainless windows from ry ry.

Sam: 5 warm bowls of summer milk.",5
Gattaca,Ryan,"as I was watching this movie I coined a new literary term that nobody has ever heard of called ""show don’t tell""

the first 45 minutes of this movie it just told me all that stuff and I found it fucking unforgivable and it grated on me so badly.

why couldnt this movie just told this to me in linear fashion instead of ethan hawke vomiting exposition at me for almost an hour.

i couldnt get over that, the rest of the movie did not feel earned cause that so it gets 2 chickenshit michaelphelpses brothers

Every Which Way But Loose,Ryan,"cool.

For my review im going to quote the wize words of eddy rabbit ""testin my resistance and its wearin mighty thin, got the feeling I should leave before the roof caves in and I feel the need to hold you close and love the night away while you are turnin me every which way but loose""

i really liked the orangutan. he was great. i struggled with everything else. it kinda just melted from my brain. so much of it disappeared from my mind, but it was fun to talk about and clyde rules - so im gonna give it 2 pissens shittens fartens and ass kickens.",2
