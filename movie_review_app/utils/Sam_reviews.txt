4 5 from sam

would give 3 rather than 2

retroactive take score down from 4 to 3 
middle of the road film for me  he thought it was tight but then changed his mind 
rate movies more just on the feeling i get when the movie is done  feel free to criticize or rate however i want  this one made me feel crazy  movies that are memorable that people select are wild swings  i am appreciating that more and more
it was fun im glad i watched it no hot take
um  this is one my dad loves it  he wants me to like it  the more i watch it th emore i am kinda charmed by it  stupidness in it  made for me  boxer moves to his ancestral homeland  doesn’t do it 
2 spiked cigarettes
not a perfect movie  really ejoyed  zina and i will split  looking forward to watching this one  give 4 baaboa

love this kind of movie  had a ton of fun watching it  obviously a very shitty movie  these kind of movies are very fun to talk about but  the rating for me kind of cancels out i enjoyed it  but it you  know  it sucks  3 like bruce lee but betters
movie like this  we havent had everyone trying to talk over each other with only 5 people  discussion 5 stars  film 2 man eating chickens
that shit makes me feel anxious and angry but it disolves everyhign like that for me sense of nostalgia watching it for am ovie ai havent actually really seen ive prolly  already given my criticism of it i was gonna go 2 but i think wathin that end credits scheen i love a good com about averyone having fun on set i think it brings something to gether for somethign that brings some thing holsesome and fun
iw ould rather suck a dead dogs dick than watch this movie again  zero dimple pies may god have mercy on your souls
mines always anti clactic never hav ea lot to say already talking about what i liked about this film i usually try to rate based on what i felt  if something i seen multiple times gotta take into acount how it stuck with me  from expericen  4 sunlgass  rewatch  i had forgotten a lot abou tit  it doesnt necessarily stick wiht you figured id have fun watching this  averaging all those things aout 3 pairs for me 
johnson  fun 
sam  tons of fun i mean im a little conflicted  coulda gone 4  say what you think i fucking love this movie would recommend this to everyone 

i enjoyed this movie a lot  i though it was a nice little mystery thirller  dint like donald sutherland but liked seeing him on screen liked general atomesphere rating off experience and it was  yeah it was a great vibe  said enough of my thoughts  give it 3 licks of d sutherland s toothpaazed 

ive said everything i need to 3 screams  thassa good scream 
i just did this  the things i had was a shitty day yesterday and when i sat down and started watching the second half of this movie that i was finishing i was having fun pretty quickly 

this movie was a breeze to watch  it wasn’t a waste of time  i m between 2 and 3  gonna go with 3 rotten sons of bitches 
i slightly disagree i guess  but i don’t disagree with the negative things said i guess  first time same as this time  i do keep coming back to one thing i oculd go on an don i do agree with this being heavy handed  the subject matter was not treated delicately enough  i complain a lot on this podcast 

jordan  just for us 

sam  i complain about movies not being interesting anymore  done by committee  you don tsee the personality of the creator coming through  i do think this movie was interesting  i was entertained  felt like tuning in  i felt like there was a lot about it that made it worth watching  im gonna do a hot take  three eaten hearts in a hand 
its an experience i had a lot fun with it  you know i split these movies into two  i was very much looking forward to watching the second part  some of the stuff with the priest i was gettting kinda bored  sometimes jordan will bring up in a movie aaah maybe this movie wasnt for me  well this movie was for me 
you had 
suit up
bros on adventure
guns just like  getting after it
havin fun
everyone having fun with our friends
liked it
i gotta be with my bro johnson  quad quad shotguns  was gonna go tri quad shotguns  experiance of talking about movie made me go quad end of review 
couple housekeepings  my dad is 69 aroooooooooooooo 

wanted to point out and brag  i have won the last three movie picking guessing games  tis last one i had like this ewird sense of prescience as it was getting started  i needed to know what movie was gonna be picked  i just know  its gonna work out  and um  god shined his beautiful light on me and i won 
jordan  bless up king

i picked this movie off the dome  its a bit of a bornig pick  nice fun pick  everyone gonna like it  thinking about when w were going to be watching it  something a little more easily digestible might be the ticket  you can then copy and paste what shag said  its exactly how i feeel  its kind of a perfect little doc in a lot of ways  like figure skating  theres a level  gymnastics  theres a level of difficulty for your routine  you need higher difficulty for a 5  not a lot of threads  arcs or any of that  it can t be a perfect score  so  im gonna just complete the package  4 types of people who are the type of dog to bite back 
bit
ive said pretty much everything i wanted tos ay about this moovie  this is 5 juicy fruits out of a fishbowl  i fuckin loved this movie  the era made it so that it felt weirdly nostalgic  felt it with too wong foo  when you watch a movie from the 90s youve never seen before and you enjoy it  so fuckin funny and th emoral complexity was so interesting and balanced so well 

cant believe i havenot seen it before gonna take 5 juicy fruites from that fishbowl 
gotta disagree with my esteemed collegue hake  by all metrics iw ould use to judge acting  mck and seth green doing a bad jorb 

this movie fascinated me in a way i cant describe  i was tuned in  i talk all the time about weirdness and unique choices and i complain about movies not making those choices  you cant show me a movie with more weirdness and more just like    doing whatever the fuck it wants so    

on paper this one is a 3  in my heart its a 5  this averages out to 4  money
fame
success
glamours

for me 

all respect to my esteemed collegue hake but i gotta do it to him 
as a newbie to this film called gone in 60 seconds  i have had a few experiences like this where you watch something from the era we grew up in and i feel like i missed it not seeing it as a kid  this just slots right in to like my  era where like my comfort movies come from  i dont mind some of the early 2000s uglyness  objectively some of it is kinda gross 

it was just so much fun and tightly constructed  lots of moving parts that come together really well  similar to oceans 11 that i really liked  gotta give it 4 lazer cut poopy dog keys that i get my jollys off with  thats the score i ma give with it 
comin in hard like a shotgun shot 

i thought we were having fun dangerously liasons together  i thougth we were having a dangerous liason and building to some sexy interesty naughty times 

istead we just get mired in this stodgy bullshit melodrama that just got me so bored  hake is saying all the words in my head 

bored bored bored fuckin so bored  i wanna give it 1 double johnmalkovichwid  but cause i sex my wife i give 2 

i wrote her a letter on my own ass 

jordan  thats so fuckin hot 
 sam takes his shirt off 

this was fun  like others have said  this was a fun coconut to crack into to sllurp ut app of its andioxidants water 

comes close to so bad its good territory but ultimatesly falls short  the films that fall into that category have a thread of insanity to them and internal logic that is bizzarre and confounding but just sucked into the movie 

this is not 1 insane  this is a collection of insane jammed together some internaning most boring and drawn out 

i dunno  i dont think

watching bond is sherry from 100 year old wine casks this is scraping the bottom of the barrel for crusty wine skins  this movie sucks dick 

im gonna give it 1 thirsty butthole 
ill provide the counter point and im going to give this movie…  a score after i talk about it 

 sips beer 

i was prepared to come in here and give this 2 cruds 

base offa my experience with it 

primarily because i was just a littl ebit bord with it  i realize that was just a production issue 

becem more interesting listening to what was said  i was in a shitty mood when i watched it 

i still think it drags a bit a ttimes but if i read the script it would pop more than i saw  bump fro 2 to 3

3 cruds that its straj sldkfja sldkjf 3 cruds

jordan  tres crudos

sam  justein crudoo
 shirts off 
okay i got my shirt off ready to the review of the movie 

unlike jordan i was very much in the mood for this movie 

to look at some slow burn imagery and connect the dots at my liesure 

i was predisposed to be generous  but  talkin bout it with you guys obviously its become clear that any leeway i wanted to give the plot was me just wanting to give it that  um 

i always feel like ive already said everything i wante dto say and i gotta be honest speak to my experience and give it 3 trifectas if that fuckin song didnt suck so bad and make me drop it to 2 trifectas of cannibalizm 
 takes shirt off 
i could t get my shirt off 

in austrailian accent 

i watched the movie  crocodile dundee  and i said  get stuffed 

this movie was kind of a bit more boring than i expected 

fish out of water  maybe i mixed up some action that didnt happen some silly shit that didnt happen 

in retrospect just talking abou tit and talking about how it is your enjoyment of th emovie is baout how much you are charmed by paul hogan this movie goes doen in like a cold fosters i have to give it a 4 cold fosters blown off a cupples 
 takes off shirt 

ok ive got my shirt off and im ready to rate the movie  um 
this shit mostly bored me  i feel like i probably just don’t get bevis and butthead  everything i like about this movie is then done in king of the hill  non main characters  the hyper realism thats kinda gross  similar humor but in king of the hill its funny and a little heart just enough to carry a plot  and that just isnt here for this movie 

i was mostly bored by it  i have to bump it up 1 because of the soundtrack  the soundtrack is my life  for that reason i gotta give it 2 couplalilolespirdermunkeys

shake that camper 

stuff about cum 
 takes jacket off 

 takes tie off 

 unbuttons dress shirt 

i think garrisson was fully buttoned 

 takes dress shirt off 

 takes shirt off 

allright  go ahead and pop this off real quick 

okay 

 takes pants 

5 failed cigarettes failed by the rolled kevin clikne 

lemme tell you why  oh lemme explain  the score i just gave it

im about as primed as anyone could be seeing this movie but as i said noone see dis before

this was a time when i was rebelling against sfuf i had grown up with highschool

this was the year where i had the least interest in the stuff that my parents raised me on  phc was number 1 on my list 

okay they makin a movie who fuckign cares wat a buncha looosers 

last night  it was just a rebound effect  i was just flooded with stuff i hadnt realized so important this show as to my upbringing helped to break movie up into two nights  by the end ofth efirst night watching it was getting board tbh

it was a lil too much every singel seen is too much comin at you and i was kinda ready to be done about 50 mins in but splitting into two helped 

i alwasy gotta rate from my personal experience this show was 5 times he tryin to light it  5 times he tryin to light it  5 times he cant 

jordan  who s that 

same  talking about it with you gues  i just love it  the cinemaphotogrphyy so many great jokes and good performances 

not a 5 on paper but a 5 in my heart 

who 

rolled by the kevin kline 
lemme get in here 

 takes off shirt 

burpsssss

um  alright  this is a classic example of high highs and low lows 

i was having a ton of fun but like reif mentioned earlier on like kinda dropped off in the second half and kinda just    the sound design was  absurdly bad at points  to the point of making me check out 

but at the same time  django s really shootin dese guys so i gotta give it 3 coffins filled with machine guns but now is filled with gold  i gotta say django was really shootin this guy 

he was using the beautiful art invented by christian bale of  guncata 

pew pew noises 
 rock takes shirt off 
 puts tie back on with suspenders 
 looks like warp tour lead 

okay cherry poppin daddies  ew gross

metropolis  zoot suit riiots in metropolis  break a bottle of beer 

lot of fun getting dvd in the mail  just like  a movie i anticipated watching a lot  i hadnt really heard of it before  i maybe heard about it but conflated with metropolis  the more famous movie 

i was very excited to watch it but ended up being very disappointed 

it doesnt take much to get me on board with a high concept speculative sci fi  a good story that would be great 

you dont want to give me that  you dont want to give me a tightly constructed narrative  thats fine 

just give me some interesting characters 

okay  you gonna give me rock with no backstory and retarted teema and uncle who s sun is getting fulshed through sewer system

how does this society fucntion  show me gears and cogs of the people so i can sink my teeth into that and it will be fine

no   

thats fine 

i jsut need it to be really really cool to look at and aesthetically pleasing to me 

this almost ticked that box for me  some scenese tickled me a bit 

the cgi i dont want to hold that oo bad 

indelecitlaty jammed in there  the aesthteic didnt do it for me gonna give it 2 uncles who dont give a shit about their nephews 
 sam takes of tie 
 takes off shirt 
alright  mr jealousy 
mr jealousy
mr jealousy

so i realized i don’t watch a lot of relationship dramas  a good one kinda hits me really hard 

not necessarily emotionally  but the awkwardness  scenes where he s lying  being jelous  those scenes are viscerally painful for me 

it cuts through and gives me the feeling that i know what the scene ist rying to give but is not always present 

but when i am trying to watch one it can be a pretty intense experience 

i got this with this movie  i was really there with it  i was enjoying the comedy  i was being lenient with what i didnt like  i was watching it with rose tinted glasses 

this conversation brought me down in a way was needed  i enjoyed this film and am excited to seeing noah bombach film  and knowing zina is going through his stuff im excited  im at the start of a beautuful relationship with a director i dont know that much so 4 therapy sessions with bogdonbononivich alec boolyon bogdonovich peter bogdonovich
can you guys hear this

 plays its not unusual 
 takes shirt off 

 dances 
  sings review to tom jones  its not unusual   

it s not unusual to think mars attacks was fun 

it s not unusual to think mars attacks was dumb 

and when i see these martians shooting these lazer guns 

its not unusual to give mars attacks 3 attacks 

keepin in lk
 takes off shirt 
 takes off pants 
 pops boner 

so this was an interesting watch  its always fun watchign stuff about the soviet union with zina because she provides fun interesting context  i don’t have a lot to say because that quote about talking about art is like  something about architechture

wrigitn about music is like dancing about architecture

my eyes like to wacht this movie im going to give it three  talks with buttcrack  three salkerballexxies  said in high pitch voice  lol

hake  dude  you just showed us your butthole man 


 takes off shirt 

so 

 shows monkey bone 

i kinda thought i knew what i was in for  i thought this was some sort of shitty 2000s comedy i have seen a million of dem  brendan frazier on his downswing 

then the movie began to unfurl like an orchid and release its sweet scent 

by the time brendan frazier and dave foley were wearing matching silver suits and bob odenkirk and chris katan i was fully monkey boned up

theres a lot wrong with this movie  but what s right is tight and what s tight is fuckin tight 

the conversation we have helps to shape my score  but this shit was rubber stamped as soon as the credits rolled and dont let anybody stop me on chris katan kevin hake is the most exciting new voice in movie night club and fresh young exciting virulent kevin hake sexy voice in movienight club  5 organs from chris katan 


put the inlaws to bed 

puts on that song from the movie

 keeps it low key 
last season was too horney  i retire from stripping 

i really loved this film i was just very touched by the dislpay of male friendship and was very  provoked  from a thought perspective by the nuanced take on alchohol and your relationship with alchohol and how it can deteriorate your life in a lot of circumstances 

i thought he toke was so interestingly spry  throughout  when ive heard discussions about whether or not this was a comedy and couldnt see why this was up in the air and then tommy fuckin    got eaten  by sharks  this is such a dramatic film until the end  4 with a point in front for my b a c 

no hot takes or int  th to say just lubbit 
i enjoyed it i wonder sometimes if a movie needs to deliver on the promise that it sets up in the first act  this one did not  im glad i watched it 2  doses 
walther mathow 

um don’t hav ea lot 

 takes off his shirt 

 is wearing a skinsuit 

 does  yoga  

 fakes injury 

respiro  i don’t have a lot interesting to say about this movie that i havent already said  i was enjoying it scene by scene a lot more than i did the macro vision  my enjoyment of it was very very high  partially because of the filmmaking skikll of moldovar 

its a movie presented as a mindfuck that holds your hand the whole time  interesting dichotomey if you were to explain someone spell it out  but they just kinda tell you everything that is happening as it is happening 

doesnt make me feel any particular way whatsoever 

loved this conversation  was very activating  very stimulating  the film itself i gotta give it 3 non consentual vaginal plasties 
let me build off of that with a review 

so jumping of what my collegue jordan said  expounding on what he had to say  i also liked movie 

i don’t hav ea lot else to say that i havent already said  i was in it scene to scene  for sure 

i wasnt really thinking about the macro stuff  for the vibe 

tonight some of the questions i hadnt cared to answer came to the forefront  my enjoyment in retrospect was not same as in the time 

i started closer to where jordan ended up  i was knocked down a lot by the conversation  start maybe a 4  knocked down to a 2  but then i was forced to buy this movie  cant justify buying 8 daollars for i fascniens aside its probably a 3 for me i really enjoyed it might watch it again tonight  not going to defend it but going to defend it  3 drips of nitroglycerine
im glad i didn’t prepare much  it would have been a cherry on top of hakes cherry that he already provided and popped 

i kind of watched it at the end of the day and was not super enthused  i was more bored with it than i thought  i was worried it was kind of boring for you dudes 

i was worried kinda to talk about how this movie doesnt bear rewatching and goign through it the second time lost its lustre and then hake went through and said watching it time 2 was the tightest shit ever  i was gonna choose 3 swords but the conversation brought me up to choosing 4 swords 
medium raw was better than this  0 distressed cowboy denims 

this shit was fucking trash  i would watch medium raw a 100 times and beat my own dick if i ever have to watch this movie again 
this season is a good color  a nice lilac  so i m excited to fill out this season as we get closer to the round of 64 

after watching this movie was was worried you guys were gonna be mad because it was boring at parts 

this is the first movie that i picked not knowing much about it  other than having mentioned the title probably 700 times in my life as a joke 

i was super worried  aw shit this sucked  people gonna think this is borning  this conversation was fun 

it reminded me a bit of jupiter ascending  picking this shit apart  there was such a poorly made movie to stick our fingers in the seems and pry them open and shit in and rub the shit in and smell it and think it was fuckin cool 

 jordan  is this the tom arnold bit 

white people are crazy 

i was prepared to give it a very low score  but the conversation was good so im gonna give it a pretty low score of 2 of course i rememebter wht it was 2 starchy heron sthurtz 
 starts talking like john waters 

well alright  ill just go and give a review 

about the movie 

whats the movie  its pink flamingos  here i am and here im doing it 

i think john waters would agree and that’s me im john waters and im doing my perfect john waters voice

it felt like watching hi to you or lemon party like the fun fun internet movies i watch as a child

this has culturualy value to this movie in 1972 but that movie has disippated 

it starts in a time where stars mean nothing and nothing exists

1 dancing butthole and im john waters and thats my review of my movie 
i am in a stretch right now it s probably the busiest work stretch in a 3 day period 

ive been in kinda a shitty mood  having to put this movie off and off and off and didn’t get a chance to watch it until today  and i had to watch it in increments 

i was fully prepared to not appreciated it or watch it or  i wasnt looking forward to watching it and it drew me in whether i liked it nort 

this is the movie im looking for in movie club 

it scratches the itches im scratchin with james bond and action and 70s black culture asthetic it goes down smooth for me

my experience watchin this movie was awesome one of the best movie club night watches ive had in a long time

i was in a shitty mood now im in an awesome mood

thank you johnson

im gonna give this 4 patriotic biker no    patriotic torturer biker titty 

patriotic topless biker tities

is that it 

i didnt bring it up any of the quallms that flawed it but i had a lot in common with it 
difficult for me to review this movie objectively  because this was one of the frist really good comedy movies where i was old enough to understand what was goin on 

it was basically portraying my brothers generation  it was what i looked up to  so cool  expected it to be boring or overly problematic 

instead i was having so much fun  the movie hums along from scene to scene even with jeremy london delivering flat lines 

when the movie is not funn  which it is a lot of time time when it was not funny it was having fun and i just feel like 

i feel like ther ewas not a 5 minute point in the movie where i was bored or starting to look at my phone 

i had a fucking blast this was awesome im gonna give it 4 chocolate coverated stink palms 

zina loved it
shag  hoopa hoppa  just wait for that jupies video  that’s all i gotta say

sam

given my review can be dangerous business 

 singing ensues 

pretty much in agreement with hake 

i was havin fun  and i wasn’t havein fun  i was swinging wildly like a 1 to a 4 in this movie  there was a lot of potential but it was hard to susse out the pie that tasted like shit 

mostly tasted like shit  like blue chips  i was pretty harsh on and didnt give a great score  i would be bustin my shit at garey buseys antics  mcnulty  nick nulty   

nicholas nulty 

so i htink this one could age well on me  the experience wasnt great  the conversation was great i got to go with 2 rogers and park  major friend kevin 
clears throat 

not gonna get into what i didn’t like about this movie  because that is well documented 

i liked the premise because i was looking forward to watching to it and the first 20 minutes was something i was interested in a lot and i had a spec of enjoyment watching thsi movie so i give a spec of a score 1 geoncider
lemme burn this bitch down 

spidahman  soul spidahman 

i sort of came at this from the opposite angle of some of my esteemed collegues 

i was really having fun out fo the gate  not expecting to to be good and giving it a lot of leeway  i was enjoying it scene by scene  while leetting some fo the macro aspects ssort of wash away and not beinportant to me 

nejuoning the scene and feeling steeped in a sort of vibe that makes me feel nostolgaic makes me feel nostailci as one of part of my life at any part in in time 

i was coming into this riding pretty high and you guys brougt me back down to earth so watch me now im coming in hot and its 3 enduring friendships   

this movie had more female screen prescense than any other fuckin movie on our movie night 

holly is cool af 

time travel shit is not my jam  i hate connecting the red yarn  red yarn should not be sold 

you should not collect newspaper clippings

in the fullness of time we are one in the infinite void space

i didn’t like tenet that much  but  daddy likey this movies 

i liked the conciet  the sci fi worldbuilding was good  part of not liking time travel is i turn my brain off when it happens 

i was just enjoying the scenes and trusting that it all fits together 

led me to have a higher opinion of the movie after then  gotta dock it a little pointy point and include 3 flaming faces including the lips  great movie choice rachel 

hake stole my thunder thinking i d be cynical boy turned good  but oh my god    

sam froze 

i m back  its not my internet its my computer  there is a lot i actively hated about this movie  alot we didn t get into  i don t know if its that good  if you came into this with a cynical eye you could tear it apart  but the vbe of this movie  i love my mommy  so yea  i can t fuck around  i give this 4 tbds 

im like  confused as to how i feel about this movie 

i think i know how i feel from a aratings perspective  

theres a lot of spinning gears like stuff lost in translation  how much leeway do you give it being under the iron curtain  the whole speaking truth to power thing is not just an art movie thing    thats an everymovie thing 

viel of communist russia has a crooks being baddies and cops being goodies 

performances were funny and seeing soviet russia on film is kinda cool and kinda fun 

so i enjoyed it 

but  i gotta go 2 gowns with mother of pearl buttons 

jordan   robes 

zina   i think its a robe 

sam   i misspoke 

jordan   it is decided 

zina   its like a dressing gown 

sam   you translated it for us 

jordan   okay 

zina   does reif do this verbatim  

sam   reif has never ever misstyped anything ever but he maykes more money buying and selling cryptonic cyrpo currencies 

i want to jump off jordan s challance and stir the shitpot  i don t think this is the greatest batman ever  i ve heard it many times  people love detective batman  and that s great  but i love ninja batman  this batman seems a little clumsy  he is too human  shag will tell you  you don t want vulnerable human stories  you want big ninja stuff  i love this movie  as a kid  you have the same junk food over and over and stop because it just loses its ability to give you the same pleasure and that is how dc stuff is for me  i used to watch it over and over and now it doesn t hit the same way  so   no hot take gotta give 4 bat a rangs  i ll take what i used to feel and mix it with what i feel now  5 then  3 now  so 4 

of the dome here we go  i broke the 2 minute barrier right before we got on tonight  wanted you guys to know  this is when you pee for over 2 minutes straight 

when i started peeing  my lower abdomen looked like there was an alien inside of it  and it was fuckin crazy  2 minutes and 9 seconds approximatly 

we went out to dinner and it was a long drive back but it got uromysotisis poisoning 

now onto da movies  i had such a fun time watchin this 

i was really really busy the last few days and had to squeeze this in awkward segments and that can affect the enjoyment of the movie 

i agree with some of the criticisms of the movie and would not have brought up on my own like a coward but i get the criticism s

i love old school entertainers and musicals  and also they can be a drag  and this gave us a little hit of what i like about musicals and just being a pretty funny comedy without a lot of the music driving the story  but largely its a funny tapdancing comedy 

i love julie andrews and havent really seen her in much but mary poppins and i fuckin loved this movie i fuckin lvoed it  i gotta fuckin give it 5 small rages who was small rages norma 5 small rages from norma norma s small rages 

i was going to do four and started talking about the movie and im like no  i dont give a fuck  i love this movie 
here i got 

this shit was hot out the gate for sure 

i was belly laughing early and often  really having a great time  i felt pretty confident that i knew what i was in for  and that confidence continued for most of it perobably the first hour  but i feel like after the pageant really shoulda been wrapped up after the pageant 

everything was really fine after the pageant felt really untidy that seemed unnecessary  there was a good movie there that could have been wrapped up in minessota 

i had a blast with this movie  but those were issues 

all the retard stuf  anorexic stuff  peodophile stuff not great  gonna give 3 melted beercanhands  maybe in 3 months ill be at a 5 

im looking forward to a rewatch of this film 

this was  experietial  i dunno i have so many films on my list that i know im gonna love that are gonna be really well put together packages and great stories…

in many ways i come to movie club to be forced to watch shit that  i wouldn’t ordinarly see otherwise 

i struggled with this and was trepedatious about what i was getting into  once i got ready to let it wash over me  i was having a lot of fun 

this is going to stick with me  it was a unique experiecne and the more i do it the more i value the weird ass singular experiences over tightly constructed packages 

my take is lukewarm 3 little ciggies  i liked this one  thassit 
 takes shirt off 

we re back with the boys 

i have my shirt off and im gonna do my review now of the movie 

so this was a confusing one  what a perfect selection to kick off boys only movie club lifetime 

i was having a lot of fun for most of the movie  and in talking about it i think i gaslit myself into enjoying this movie more than i should have 

thinking about the plot made me angry and have criticisms cause they tried to do too much  there was a lot there and that kinda makes me upset 

there was potential in multiple directions and they tried to pursue them all an ddidnt stick the landing for any of them 

i think snoop did a good job but i gotta do 2 maggot rainhouses 
so i can offer a rebuttal to the garbage that i just heard spill out of someones trashole that the call a mouth when they say the music is mostly the detriment 

this was my favorite sountrack  the soundtrack is so sloppy and analogue  if you like sorcerer but not like tangerine dream 

you can telll its some dude with his old ass synths just some crazy weirdo doing this at his studio in the vatican or somethin 

i will agree that the gore is good sort of  its visceral it hits you 

and thats it  the rest of it was so trash and so boring and like i don t really want to get into it because there was very little that i liked about it 

it was a decent set up but just the sloggiest poorlyiest petered out and it was all over 

two tits out scuba divers 
ill be short maybe 

i  uh  i like metaphors 

you go to a restaurant and you get the menu and you are pretty excited to order  all the ideas of the dishes are good like 

im gonna watch this dennis miller tales of the crypt like low stakes and stupid 

what it was was boring and drab and the asparagus was overcooked  some of the stuff on the menu didnt show up in the dish 

it didnt work  which doesnt always piss me off  but if it had worked i think i woulda enjoyed it  i guesss i gotta gvie it 2 pussy trains to stinky station 

i hated dennis miller  i was glad it was short 
johnson  higher than the piece of garbage  the american astronaut 

sam  i sign some of those songs to myself in my head 

it was science  and anthropology 

second time watching this  was able to sort of relax  this was one of the best rewatch experiences i ve had 

i feel like it gives you the ability to let go  from a narrative perspective 

i just wasnt stressing too hard how you get there 

which was good  i just had like alll my final projects due monday  and i ve been more stressed than i have been for as long as i can remember 

this was a really great dark experience because i ve been in a dark mindset  and it was cool to watch it suffer me and after the movie i felt like shit and was really strung out and in a bad mindset 

i knew i was going to start feeling better in a few days  so i was just gonna let it tug me around a bit because i knew i would be safe where it takes me  sort of not really that safe it hurts 

i think watching it a second time  you can set yourself up for an experience that is really moving in a way that was inexplicable 

that s what i want from an arthouse film  i don t have a ton of criticisms of this movie im gonna give it 4 trash feathers 
you are the captain now 

look at me i am giving the reivew now 

good movie 

should i say more 

um  i fucking love this movie  it kind of is not a similar movie but it gives off a similar vibe as roesmary s baby like a horror movie that doesn’t hit you over the head with its horror movie 

it is light and breezy to watch  it just suprises you with some of the violence but ultimately its contained and tight and well written and the tone is easily digestible  that s rob schneider  he makes tight little packages  at least he did at the time 

i gotta give this one 5 lil bitchly cow corns 

after the first time i watched it  i knew i loved it  its gotta be in my top 10 horror movies of all time 
i am undecided  let this review pour forth from my mmmmmmmouth 

i am really conflicted about this one because i love carpenter and i feel this movie was missing a lot that i liked about the score and the body horror stuff and violent aspects  like the sexuality was missing a bit 

i did love the portrayal of a genuinely strong protagonist in the late 70s  i like a mystery  don t feel like it panned out super convinceingly 

the ride felt a bit like her apartment  a little beige  my expectations skewed how i view the movie it was a bit weird and skewed in that carpenter way but it was cookie cutter with parts that i genuinely liked 

this conversation made me see it more positively than i did going into it  i give it 3 grabbed shards of glass  glabbed sharbs of window  3 grabbed window shards

3 almost glabbed shards of grabs 
i am responsible for reviewing the movie to movie 

just second 

mmm 

just hafta get the mood lighting correct dawling 

mumble  talk about the moobie dawling 

it comes and goes  ill keep the red light 

i usually watch these movies in the evening  oo my drink  in two stints  and it has contributing to me being most positive reviewer 

i set myself up for short stints  in a good mood  pretty relaxed  willing to give myself over to the movie 

i see things in a slightly more positive light 

we had to fit this in afternoons  kinda busy  when it happens i assume that im just gonna enjoy it less 

that didnt fuckin happen at all  this shit drew me in immediately 

in love with the shitty low rent aesthetic  what im lookin for is to go with it earnestly and give me the experience that its coming from just one phsyco going for everything 

shung chi is like a movie put together in a board of directors  i didnt know depalma had that psyco fever dream inside of him so i gotta give a quad stack beef 4 beef 4 beef 4 beef 
sam has floor 

okay so  heres what i hab to say about du moobie  i was um  very excited about noir aesthetic  but i haven t seen that many movies 

a lot of stuff im into borrows but it’s a blindpot for me that i would like to fill in to scratch that itch 

havent seen orsen welles movies  including citizen kane  interested in him as an actor but dont know about his performance 

was kinda just bubblin along with this movie  but the last 30 minutes were fckin crazy 

i dont really feel super strongly  gotta give it 3 sweaty excitable brizbaayyys 
please type into me next and make it hurt 

i would like to share my screen for my review though 

it s kinda unprecedented 

sam shows image of tom waits  or william burroughs  or whatever  with weird music

nice 

i didnt think that i was lovin this movie for large protions of it  it kinda drew me in in the last half

thinking about it has givin perspective 4 crown brand entry passes to recursive nightclubs 

just clubs 


re energize you with some songy dance 

from the 80s 

talky heads song gone be tuff  speaking faces joint 

does that song by talking heads 

i think more than everyone here we have been expressing a general discontent without really putting very specific fingers on the flaws of this movie 

i think i felt that more than everyone else 

when ray liotta showed up and stole thes creen it was a shift in the movie and then petered out so gonna give 2 virginias for lubbers for luber tershirts 

 shows tasteful cartoon porn with spongebob 

i don’t like this movie 

it also was a thinker 

and a stinker 

i saw this movie as a kid  i saw it on tv on comedy central or tnt and picked it up as it came  i knew it was gonna suck 

i forgot to write a song 

ive got an idea  i m gonna get an extension and turn in two decent assignments next week 

maybe that s why ive been dissociating and putting hentai on the screen but

i knew this was gonna fuck this im gonna do my own song 

i knew it was gonna be bad  but i thought it would be fun  i was certain this would be fun 

it was joyless 

all you really want for this is for the lead to be really charismatic and to carry the story even if it sucks and chris tucker and orlando jones to do this thing and be in a dumb shit movie 

we didnt get that we got this instead so i gotta go with 1 computer generated kablonkablonk  also ryan thank you for the pizza 

 burps 

i think yall were a lil hard on the mikey 

some of the takes i was hearing were wild  and wrong 

mike meyers schtick is old and aged poorly  when you let go to treat it like modern material it is charming 

it is good and everyone who got pissed about it like  comon this is a time capsule of the movie 

the movie is a valid breezy little flick  its not trying too hard to be anything mind blowing or subversive but ultimately it boils down to mike meyers annoying the shit out of you 

i think mike meyers has amazing chemistry by the sea and flirty for the first time with the russian sailors  there are times where this really fits the bill of a romantic comedy  exactly what you would want from it 

maybe this movie works for me and why i chose it  this shit slaps 

mike meyers is annoying  that s for real 

 6    36   40   76

i also don’t have too much to say  this is one of those ones where strong opinions on both ends cancel out all the opportunity for hot takes 

had my problems with julia robert s character arc and trail of wealth as an ultimate aspirational goal  like i said i had a shitty day but i wasnt havin a shitty time watchin this movie  but i was flowin through it those kinda come together and put me at 3 cow turd cow pie betzy devos 

jordan  ya got it 


comin in really hot 

roman knowledgie 

i actually don’t have a lot to say  which is why i wanna get it outta the way 

i enjoyed this movie when aubrey hepburn  aubrey hepburn  plays wide eyed incredibly naïve young princess who classily and passively agressively tells off her staff at the end like  its not gonna be like that anymore 

gregory peck i belive buti enjoy watching audry peck 4 truthy hands inside monster jesusesss mouth 
talks about his dick a bit 

alrighmoe  a tale of two halves  i watch these movies in two halves  my unadultered wife zina  some of you have met her  shes her girlfriend or her wife  side girl and one wife  some met girl and other met wife 

i was havin so much fun the first half were both laughin a lot  really kinda down with the bizarre flow of things  imperfect things i didnt like that i liked  every thing that sucked was charming 

the second half i was having such a bad time with it i had to question if i was in a shitty mood  like that will happen some times 

i came to the conclusion that i was wrong  no im in a great mood and this shit is a slog and bummin me out  an interesting experience overall which is all you can ask for in a movie club

3 cucumbers in jennifer gerderns ass  jacobs ladders ass 

allow to me speak on the moobie 

i watched the moobie  and now ill talk about it 

it will begin… now 

i… got home today after a bunch of mini clincal hours and this was not really the vibe i was looking for  which was fine 

this was a perfect storm of being in right head space to enjoy this film 

maggie gylenhaal is pretty wonderful in some of the spots in this film    the black comedy works  is so dark as to beintersting 

the strangeness is enough to keep you off balance the entire way  which is potentailly interesting as long as it makes good on that uneasyness  as long as it gives you something to make sense of what you just watched 

i think this movie shits the bed at the end  i thought this movie stunk it was stinking up the whole house as i was watching it i gotta give it 1 brush spanks in the bafroom 

like what am i doing i fucking hated this movie 

 while eating a cookie 

so this movie kinda like a chocolate chip cookie 

really sweet  tastes pretty good 

and it goes down easy 

but its not super complex 

ultimately when you are done with it you want some more 

whats name of guy in the lead 

billy campbell

billy campbell should be blacklisted from hollywood 

i feel like you shouldnt like this because im going to go off on a story 

this is opposite world because jordan watched 2 takes and i watched 1 

i was wearing a watch and it hurt and was itcy  and then i had an infected cut under my watch  with red lines branching down my arm  staph infection 

internet told me to go to see medical care  and i got antibiotics and im fine 

i think its from the dog that scratched and infected me 

couldnt watch on monday and had to watch on tuesday 

my watch is ground zero for bacteria and it left and festered 

3 sticks of beamon s pepsin gum 
its not like have anything mooch to say but im gonna say it 

i already mentioned the two tones of the xperience watching this movie 

after the first half i was ready to go  i was pretty excited i didn’t know whwere it was gonna go  i twas gonna be a tour deforce by david allen pierce 

i and i was like whatever happens him doin his thing theres gonna stay in the house and twists in the house and then the second half stretch itself and strech itself and try to be something more than that with every attempt it makes to expand the mystery box  the mystery box is actually made of pringles and its full of shit 

and its actually what you found it out its a puddle of lidless pringless shithouse 

suprisingly thats not what what we are rating it out of and what we are rating it out of is 2 of the cheeky lil miystery boxes 

theres a lot to suck down my gullet 
fam  i could review the movie to be perfectly honest fam 

gonna go off king 

not surprising based on my comments  i didn’t feel as quite as warm as fuzzy as some of my esteemed collegues  did

i fuckin hated this movie  this movie was stinky trash  billy crystol was miscast and danny devito was miscast  people bringing up good lines and yeah there wer some funny parts 

just the farce they were going for felt very farced  like the repeated fakeouts like we dont need a minute buildup of danny devito not killing his mom 

didnt really care what was going on  didn t feel sympathy for danny devito  felt like he was a dangerous sketchy individual 

didnt think there was any sort of kinship between billy kristol and didnt like it certainly didnt love it  1 coffee table novel books that are most filled with the women i gotta pork 

don’t have a lot of specifics to remember  so im going off pure vibes 

this was one that like hooked me from the very start 

just the world i was put in was a world i feel very comfortable in  smouldering white guy blues guitar  stevy ray vaughn wasnt even dead and i felt his simmering tuned in soul from dropped d 

hake mentioned the straight guy thing  that stuck with me  they are both kinda being stright men 

i loved it even though we moved on from it 

i think this works because noone is being too wacky or biting too down onnit  even scene with daughter  this movie is finessing its way through the plot that would nornally be a hammy slapsticky comedy so i gotta give 4 non counterfeit counterfiet counterfit non counterfiet twentyes 

i did it all good and rite 
ill have what he s havin  that sounds really really good  ive been holding on these 5 day saving piss pots and not having anything to do with them  im happy i had a place to put them 

startling imperfection  absolute lunacy  art funneled through the mind of an unwell individual with a lot of power over the product he ultimately did create 

its what im looking for  it just felt like surprising and thrilling and just entertaining all the way through 

i love this fucking movie  easy 5 for me  no sweat 

sam  770 6
johnson  740
kevin    
so this was a very satisfying experience for me 

because i brought a movie to you guys that i had weird feelings about from watching as a child and you all intelligently broke down why i felt that way 

you unravelled the mystery so now i can ascend to the 50th deadworld and light erupts from y mouth 

i did agree with every criticism of the movie 

but i think the visuals were nice  i think playtime i was higher on it than most people 

this film i just  im more of a verbal guy  but like when a film is this interesting with the art direction and props and costumes  i can float along and see past the glaring mistakes 

that leadss me to 3 peas and carrots in a problematic puke pile 


sorry i had to hop on late 

we had plans for ellen was her birthday and i forgot 

but  wish i woulda been on for the beginning to hear reifs historical speal  i gotta get on the wikipedia to soak in the history  i love historical epics 

this one has been on my list for a really long time  god it was so stupid in parts 

the writing  the acting was terrible in a lot of parts  really bad  and i dont care 

i   like i just love a film that spans decades  i dont know if theres any film that takes over the place of this many years thats not gonna get 4 turds in a bowl  4 turds in a bowl  really really liked it 

just like especially like the feeling it gave me at the end  i just feel like it was a unique experience and im glad that i had it im drunk 
in the credits 

prosecutor   played by thick wilson
prison guard   played by glenn beck

i m kinda bummed i didn’t see this when it started 

i loved waynes world 

i love rick morainis 

i don t know dave thomas real well  but i feel like i love him 

i feel like this    speaks to me about hake because hake is known to have this    incredible taste 

if you have to have more conversations about serious affair  deep down he s a silly little goosaroony  you say the word  poopy  and he s a chucklin  so i ma give it 3 two minute pisses onna loony bin 
i have a lot of smart stuff to say 

um  this one was the movie i watched it when i was younger and i watched it now 

man i donno  reif i feel like i did you a little dirty in respecting the sentimental truce  but then you bring it out 

it was fun bringing a little spice  fun getting you activated talking about the movie 

i feel complicit in its being brought forth  and i remember loving it when we watched it and having our minds blown 

i think jordan brings up a good point in the so bad its good or so bad its worthless category  i think there s a reason why its so stuck in my head and not much about its poignency  something going on in the sauce that tastes a way in that it s worth slurping down three taye digg s faces on the floor 

three dina menzel tayediggs squarefaces 

what if instead oysters you get taye diggs face 
just show me a special boy with a special bat  specially if that special boy looks especially old 

shows robert redford 

you thought i was racist for picking a movie with no black people  he tought bagger vance how to play baseball

he talkes to him how to be wise 

how to use the glasses

friends with bernie williams 

um  

good at throwing a baseball  hes like 38 years old

randy newman make me thinking of michel mcdonald 

its not my favorite movie of all time but close to movie im most sentimental about

glad you guys liked it  i was fully prepared to ikill my idols and have the shine taken off it 

i was watching it with more clear eyes and its defintely not a perfect movie by any means 

yeah i was able to tap into what i liked the most about it and its one of my favorites gimem 5 poisoned little morsel tartlets to eat wheres pop and where randy neuman bleh 
 shows chuck berry farting in sex worker s face 

enough bullshit 

i remember watching this little ditty as a child and really enjoying it but being a little putoff by it 

this movie does kinda present itself in a way… where you can see parents showing it to their kids and then being like  what the fuck  this thing is eating parts of this person 

that really tickled me this time  this sort of fun puppety carefree element mixed with the darker comedic elements 

i had a wonderful time watching this  the vibe was very unique  johnson brought up how when musicals dont try to be too realistic when they are filmed and try to keep the stage atomesphere when they are filmed 

all the extras were just being very sorta corporatey and over effusive 

loved it gimme four glitter lilly funeral bouquets  arrangements 

the vibes were right on this one 

this is one of those rare films that i probably should have seen as a kid but i didn’t 

its one of those fun nostalgia blankets that you get put in that you never swaddled yourself in before 

i was in right away  but as i detailed during the conversation  i thought it was really clunky movie that doesnt really pay off on the promise 

but man  john candy is so very good 

and his chops so hold up so very welly

i was gonna give this two bug circumcising hatchets but that was then and this is now  im gonna give it 3 bug circumcising hatchets 
office space  rules 

my brother probably showed it to me  maybe that’s when i saw it 

i was probably 11 when this came out  this movie fuckin rocks i woulda put it up for sentimental season 

i think its hilarious its really good i love this movie you guys should love this movie   5 bobs 
some notes 

i could do that shit 

how do you get the cobra up there 

 you gotta find the right cobra 

hake  basket

sam  you turn the basket over and empty it onto the gargoyle s head 

up the mountain and out on the ledge 

 she was walking around with a loaded shotgun ready to fire me a hotone  

sounds like she  had the shits 

mr  hahn   more like mr  hands  he s got hands 

so anyways 

man this was a weird experiences because i remember having a weird expectations like jordan 

i was very disappointed starting this movie  for the first 45 minutes i was like   wtf was i watching this acting  then it just reeled me back in  

jackie chan was so good  jacket chan 

jaden  maybe he goes on to act  but maybe not  what a treat to see this talented kid light up the screen in a role that is made for me 

this movie is made for me  im gonna go 4 jackets up with attitude 


thought it would be a good idea to watch jupiter ascending with my friends  the only problem with jupiter ascending is that it is total bullshit  1 space roller blade 
allow me to review it so i can tell you what i think 

i had a lot a lot of fun talking about this  the energy tonight was very fitting  here with the jupe troupe 

i thought this film was a stinky piece of shit  it was really boring  but thankfully it was also really long 

im gonna go ahead and saddle it with 1  lil removed sunglasses 

this movie will live on well in my memory but not on the spreadsheet 
i don’t have a ton to show  so let me say you some things  shows dick 

as i was looking through pics online i saw pictures on facebook   shows a bunch fo facebook pics 

this movie was very confusing for me 

i was struggling with it for the first half  right up until the whale song  when they first start performing under the bridge  and the muscical scene i was like fuck this  i hate this  i dont care about these songs  i dont like this movie 

it then sort of tied things up together and it made sense at the end  i dont know how i feel about it so i gotta give it 3 experimental elongated mutant ghost arms 
here we go 

here we go 

i rememebr watching this as a child  this isone of those where i didn’t remember much of what happened but the feeling that th emovie game was was kinda ikcy  its kind of just  the aestheic is gross  the vibe is gross  in a way that doesn t vibe with me fore mario 

but i liked bob hoskins  i liked john leguizamo in this  i was kinda confuzed and bored at some parts  and this is wmore i gotta go    i think i didnt enjoy this more than i did enjoy it so im gonan give it 2 screamin martini worms
this is a reif movie  cause it’s a make a wish movie  reif has worked for the make a wish foundation  and making dinosuar wish stuff 

what about your parents  did they beat you 

don’t let bad happen  let no bad happen 

you must be tired after such doings 

yeah  so this shit was all fake  dumb as hell  none of it could have happened  i meant what i said earlier  the animation was messing up my ability to tap into my childlike sense of wonder  the animation felt disjointed and i was bored for a lot of it 

i liked a lot of what happeend from the circus onward  i can feel my negativity in my soul  but i have to be true to my lived experience 

so i give it 1 circuses wwith a notion with a lot of spiiiiiiiiice 

there certainly werent fuckin 4 dog 
i see myself as someone who has decent taste in films and sees heady stuff  but really i just like movies 

conversations like this i find myself not being able to figure out how i feel  and i still don’t think i know how i feel 

being bored is not always bad in the context of a film  when i am being bored i don t remember if that means my enjoyment comes from it or for the most part i will rewatch it at some point like shag 

rewatch reaction 

mostly i enjoyed seeing cohen attempts and they got better later 

lots of movie  gotta be bored myself and say 3 curtainless windows 


i don’t have anything interesting to say 

i find it difficult to talk about the quality of this movie  i usually have very strong reactions when watching a movie that just i let guide me  ecause im not a critic 

i really didn’t feel that way watchign this movie 

there was a lot that i nitpicked that just sort of made me took em out of the world like the way they chose to pick scifi and dry stage acting style not working

i dunnno i was expecting this to be a lot more interesting and dynamic than it was and it ended up feeling stale tome 

im gonna go 2 chickenshitunmichaelfphelps like brotherboys 
sam
as is tradition  let me start it off 

i gotta be honest  we were shitting on the movie a lot  and i didn’t feel particularly defensive of it 

but my experience was very positive  very low stakes movie  anything i think to bring up as a reason why i liked it  im on record like saying  that sucked 

music was terrible
acting was bad
casting was bad

but the vibes were right  im kinda a vibes guy  if you dont know me 

i gotta give it 3 pissing shitting fucking monkey buns
