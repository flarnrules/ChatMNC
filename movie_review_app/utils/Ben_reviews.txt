ending part one and part aending part one and part 25 part one and part two made in the 44 screens and the second screen


ummm alright so i watched this right before 4pm basically i didn t give it the attention it needed  i absolutely loved it  loved the soundtrack  loved the aspect that shaggy said about  the last dance   we need to film this dude because he is so dominant at the peak of his career  he was the governor of california  i cant wait to download the playlist and play it for my friends when they come over and have it play in the back ground and for them to be like what   so good so good  really solid all around  i think if i was in a better viewing environment   i will give it four dogs by dogs     dogs who fight instead of rolling over  


uh  ok so first of all let me go to my notes because honestly i loved this move and agree with sams comments  loved the wardrobe and how everything felt normal  they pushed 90s the way i would dress  its nebraska too which is like behind the times but not old timey  pretty much all the characters except paul have huge character flaws  everyone loves paul because he s a loveable guy  he wasn t too cynical  the movie was cynical but it was broken up by shots  the bee sting that becomes a fixture on his face and the peeing on the tree are so fucking funny  they live in normal life and these are abnormal behaviors  he moves to nyc and he s not crushing it  like how tammy goes to catholic school  giving the review right now has changed my opinion and it was a 4 but now i m giving it a 5 juicy fruits out of a fishbowl 

jordan  thats a 5 toothpazed if i ve ever heard one 

reif  it was so fucking good  i was surprised at every moment  i thought it was going to be about a presidential election but it kept surprising



i like malort  like other people hate it  but i drink it so frequently that i’ve grown to like it 
i haven’t been in that room that smells like farts in a while and i walked into this room that smelled like farts  i had nostalgia goggles when i recommended this movie  i remember watching this with my brother  david  on starz  i probably watched this 10 15 times in high school  and we would get hype on it  to be honest it didn’t quite do it for me this time around  there were times when i was hype on it  the heist was really good  when i was 12 or 13 or whatever  it made me feel like this movie was smarter than it really was  like why would they steal 50 cars in 1 night  like why wouldn’t they give them more time  i gave the movie the benefit of the doubt  but no  this movie is just really dumb  it’s not going to be a smart movie  but i thought it was  when nick cage plays a yuppie asshole to get a fancy car  that was pretty funny  the low rider son was pretty tight  when he said the car parts to get ugly ange  part 1 

angelina to have sex with him was pretty cool  when he jumped over all those cars with that face it was so funny  i had to keep rewinding it over and over to see his face  this movie had some good qualities but mostly bad qualities  i’m gonna have to give it 2 lazer cut poopy dog keys that i get my jollies off with   part 2 


i think i kind of waffled around a lot about what i was going to give this movie  it gets points on being a period piece and allison and i enjoyed it together  this was enjoyable to watch even though there were some parts that were not enjoyable  like the rape  it felt out of place for what the movie was going for  nice job  malkovich  did weinstein have any part in this  it felt like it had his grubby fingers all over it  1 double wigged malkovich 

i’ve seen one full sean connery movie  it’s the one where he goes scuba diving  it’s classic bond  i watched it  but don’t remember much  the first 45 mins to an hour was really sucking me in  the last hour i was not distracted at all  it was great to have on in the background  the actors gave up  the plot wasn’t great quality  it is the perfect movie to have on when you have to do something  every time i looked at it  i was like “what the fuck is happening” i don’t think that is a good trait for a movie to have  it was so unengaging  that is not what movies are for  i give this one of the patty o’tooles tittes on the moon buggy 

so  lets see here  i think everything i wanted to say i said during the conversation  allison and i enjoyed the movie a lot  a lot of nuance and to me attention to detail to not trying to explain everything to the audience  used visual story telling so that the audience should get the joke unless they’re stupid or if the audio was bad  i do agree with sam about the sound mixing or design  no one would explain it to me  and if they did i would forget it because ya know   but  if it weren’t for that i would have given it a 5 but i’m giving it 4 cruds 

vampire covenant review 
 lots of pre reif vampire chit chat 
reif  when she gets bit by skelator  vampires hate weirwolves and that’s why she hates her 
 continued vampire weirwolf chat 
skinny pete was pretty nice to her  he got the bat to protect her  i was excited to watch this because i liked drive  we watched the trailer and it was like all right  we’re gonna watch this  starts off interested with the wide angle and the blood on her  then a slow pan on like a dolly pan  so you know what youre getting into with the slow music  you know there is going to be some super natural in it with a big reveal  the suspense is building in me  every scene i am ready for the vampires and witches and spell casting  there was a lot there if you are looking for it  which i definitely was  obviously  skelator eating the eyeball was tight  but it would have been way cooler if elle fanning climbed out of her  but none of that happened  i have to give this 1 trifecta cannable  also  there was some real horrifying scenes  and not in a way i am into  i never had to look away before  but that scene with keanu and the knife was fucked up dude  i hated it  i hated this movie  i wanted to like it  i hated it  


reif  people got some words tonight  you ready johnson  ok  so  um i pretty much 100  agree with shag  i really liked the thoughts jordan put down  i really liked what johnson was saying  this whole conversation and movie were fun for me and allison to watch  the one thing  the scene that was problematic  the build up to it  like you didn’t want it to happen  then when it has that type of scene  i feel like i can give it a pass  like the context and the time  i can’t 100  give it a pass  without that scene i would have given it a 5  but with it  they could have made it fun without being a dick about it  in retrospect nobody wants to be a dick  none of my friends want to be a dick  i want to give it a 5  but i just can’t  i gotta give it 4 shooting frothies offa good boys  sometimes i look it up and try my best to remember what to say  but…  remember shooting dresses offa maids from hakes like a month ago  its like the same visually  well  that’s what i got 

sam  show him your unit  man reif when you are writing shit i am saying it makes me so subconsious  like i’m a dumbass 
jordan  i never look at it
sam  good god do i need to be making him write this out 
jordan  why am i giving a 4 paragraph review of beavis and butthead
sam  johnsons ready to go
reif  well it definitely disappointed me  i was expecting more  allison got board and i was like “dang it this is boring”  and it bummed me out  it could have done much more  it had bright moments like rollercoaster of love and the sex jokes  the sphinx with her tits out was good slapstick humor  the psychedelic scene was good too  they missed some animation frames which was lazy as fuck and it annoyed me  they should have spent more money on animation  i was disappointed in it  i’ll have to give it 1 half of 2 spider monkeys jumbling about 


im just going to watch while i   lets see what you got johnson  ummmmmmm  i really liked this movie  i agree with sam except that he was rebelling in hs but i was conforming  if i had the option to watch this with my parents  i wanted to be a part of what was meaningful  i think a huge part of that was crazy too just thinking about it  getting that stree fracture senior year  thinking about it was stuipd  but pumping iron with sam was extremely meaningful in my life  it changes the trajectory of your life  i may have gone to the naval academy  i think that i would still be a good person  but acompletely different person  if i saw this in high school i d give it a 5  but now  i d give it 4 failed rolled cigerettes by the kevin kline 

joran  i was injured too 

sam  it was special to me too  i was in your face because i wanted you to train and be on the team 

reif  i joined the xc team in the summer  i had an agreement with joe if i ran to the practice i could be on the team  i m on the soccer team  i was running 4 miles every day dude  then doing a 3 hour soccer practice  

jordan  the plex was not 4 miles away 

sam  the plex and shoaff are all connected by
yea i think that everything that has been said before has been said  maybe if i watched it with headphones  i agree with the content of jordan s words but not the score  i don’t really like westersn  but i do like tombstone  i like vval kilmer  especially in masked   anonymous  so i mean i fell asleep during this movie  i feel like the could have had more character stuff and the machine gun toward the end  that would have been more my style  all the characters are single facet which is exciting because the characters are all one thing  like the general gun slinger and woman with a dark past  that was tight  the sound design was so difficult for me to get immersersed  i wanted to enjoy it but i didn t enjoy it all that much  i had a score in mind watching it  i felt unsure about that score  i agree about my unsuredness about the score  i give it a 2 coffins that was filed with machine guns but it is now filled with gold 

i don t think it deserves a 1  i feel like if the sound design was    if i had headphones  it felt so samey  it was all these gun battles  i felt like i couldn t get a sense of weight or a connection with the characters 

sometimes people catch fire in a review and it’s great  but by the end i can’t keep up  that was  sam  you caught fire and were making jokes about moonraker or whatever and you were throwing down the funniest shit and i couldn’t write down anything 
yea so  i’ve been really excited to watch this movie for 20 years  the first time i saw imagery from this film it captured my imagination  i spent portions of the past 20 years trying to find what movie that was from  once i id’d it  it became something i really wanted to watch like 10 years ago  streaming wasn’t big then  you couldn’t buy it in a store  so i forgot about it for a while  then i remembered it for movie night and i picked it and we watched it  we have been watching it in the basement for 1 weeks  but it feels like forever  we turn the lights off and sit on the couch  putting a dvd in  you start it and let it ride  the visuals… i looked past the cgi  i feel like ghost in the shell  if they had handed off the cgi to animators it would have looked
better  i have experience with overlooking that  the visuals captivated me enough to propel me through the movie  the story is  ya know  if i was 18 it probably would have blown my puny little mind  now it’s giving me nostalgia for the time when sci fi was new and meaningfully transforming the way i looked at things  when she assimilates with the ziggurat and gives the ham fisted “humanity is fucked  i should destroy humans” i got a weird form of nostalgia  when i finished the movie it was definitely a 4 for me  it falls short in so many ways that it’s not a 5 but its definitely a 4  this movie took a beating tonight and sam is a very honest critic  hearing someone being critical of anime from a place that is fairly well constructed forethought was interesting because i didn’t have a negative reaction to it  it helped me come to terms that it didn’t live up to my expectations  i want to give it a 4  but i’m giving it a 3 uncles that don’t give a shit about their nephews 

i was actually talking about the score i was going to give it with my father in law and i wanted to know where to set up the computer  he was like  are you going to be painting during that time  it’s funny because i was painting during diamonds are forever  in general  i enjoyed the movie  alison enjoyed it as well  i respect her opinion a lot  sometimes my opinions come from a place that’s not complete  alison is my canary in the coal mine  if she doesn’t like it… it might not be good  she was like “wow this is really awesome ” i wasn’t interested in following this character around because he was a loser  this movie reminds me a lot of avengers infinity war  this is my moment to explain it  avengers infinity war is cool because the antagonist wins  but the antagonist is the protagonist from the other point of view  it has the other story structure but reversed  the other character  the protagonist  you don’t want to root for him  but  he still successfully accomplishes his goal  thanos has some justification  and he wins  he accomplishes the thing he wants  then i watch the guy who you hate win and accomplish his goals  it like mirrors it cause it’s the way mirrors work  trying to read your shirt in a mirror doesn’t work because it’s backwards because its in a mirror  4 group therapy sessions with peter bogdanovich 

i’ll be short  i don’t have a lot of strong opinions right now  i really liked this movie as a kid   i was shocked the martians just started killing everyone  i was really excited to watch this with alison  it was a pretty cool reveal  the cgi was jarring  and the lighting wasn’t great  hearing it would be a 100 million dollar film with puppets  but that money would go to pay a humongous team of artists who would love crafting these little guys with there facial expressions  it bums me out it didn’t happen  you just hope that in the future when we’re living in an economy that has no scarcity of resources  we’ll get to see that type of art get created in abundance  if anything it makes me look forward to the future as long as that future doesn’t include 4 attacks on mars  i wanted to give it 3  but it deserves a 4  i was negging the effects  but i don’t know man i have to give it a 4 

so i watched this movie today  i had to write flarnchain and i got too drunk  so i watched it today with jean  there were moments i had to put her on the ground because i didn’t know if she should be watching this  she couldn’t understand it  but there were moments when a woman was massaging a mans flaccid penis to make a dildo  is this art  i don’t know  the penis that comes out of the mold is so much bigger… my understanding is that it was so much larger than the penis that went in it  i feel like there were some interesting things in the movie  some was heavy handed  but it was the 70s so i’m going to be generous and give it 2 sexy sex footballs 

i have a confession to make  i watched this movie intermittently throughout this day but mostly toward the end while i had repetitive tasks to do  this movie was insane  i ended up probably like making hundreds of errors during that 90 minutes and it was worth it  i would never take that time back from that time gone  i have to share my position about the structure of the way the worlds interact  it was important to me  the whole thing where b  fraiser enters the dream world where it’s different than the real world  but it’s different than the blockchain of the real world  like the interchange w between the real world and the blockchain world is l different and i think the differences are meaningful even though i can’t articulate the differences  i will give this 4 organs from chris kattan’s dead body  i think if i could interchange with myself it may have been different like i could have given it 1  but it was different 

how am i doing  ok  uh  i’ll go  so  you ready  i have seen this 1 time before  it was recommended by aaron wittwer  her has really good taste  he has more knowledge about film than me  most of my deep cut knowledge came from him  i would use it when i felt knowledgably outgunned by my friends who went to purdue  iu  or ball state  i watched this and loved it 10 years ago  i watched it again on monday and still loved it  i don’t think it deserves a 5 because of some of the flaws discussed earlier  if it was shorter it would get 5  but instead it gets 4 capfuls of ghb 

i really liked this movie a lot the first time i saw it  which was like right after or before i moved  i felt like it had a perfectly subtle blend of that all sorts of emotions you could feel  it never makes you feel them too strongly until certain peaks  it breaks it in certain points which i think is great and when it’s important  like after martin smashes his face on the door and is bleeding everywhere  like i shouldn’t be drunk at work 

the second time i saw it i liked it even better  if a movie gets better the next time you see it  it gets a 5 with a point in front for my bac 

alright  this movie was recommended by my father in law bunches of times  “it going to blow your minds it’s so good ” “ok  i only get to pick once every 6 movies so chill out ” “did you pick lapsis”  like no  i told him 3 days ago that i had picked this and he was so hyped  he was like “i’m going to watch this again tonight” like 3 weeks after he watched it for the first time  anyways  i liked it  for what everyone said the first act was great  then it just sorta dragged on and peter’d out at then end  i’m going to give it 3 unusually out of place pillow fights 

so i watched this with allison last night and we were both pretty quiet watching it  watching movies in the basement is pretty great  i hadn’t had a chance to watch something in comfort like that in a long time like since high school  we didn’t talk much  there were moments like the rape scene where we were like wow this is going on way too long  this is too much  then at the end we were like that’s really good  that was interesting  sam got it right with the moral ambiguity  good use of color or whatever  my point is this movie is the good good at moral ambiguity and anything that does the good good deserves 4 nonconsensual vaginoplasties 

so this movie  i didn’t enjoy watching it a whole lot  my expectations on the name or the set up or the narrative i’ve constructed in my head can affect the way i experience the movie  this movie  to me  felt like torture during the middle parts  i liked the first sequence with the truck and the logs was good but then followed up with the truck on the rope bridge followed up with the other truck on the rope bridge  i know it should have felt weighty  but at that point in the film i had already lost interest  the characters didn’t have much dialog and the long scenes are not the style i particularly enjoy  i do think listening to a lot of the conversation about this movie gave me a greater appreciation for the film  but i’m going to go ahead and give it 2 drips of nitroglycerin 
i thought maybe it would be a 1 but talking about it there were parts i liked  like the watch and the parts at the beginning were good  it was just really boring for me  just saying it sounds embarrassing to me 

so  i watched this movie last night so i was procrastinating  but i watched it lights off  headphones on and gave it my full attention and i’m happy i did that  it was a very enjoyable experience  there were certain points when i would lol  there were joyous points or points where i would laugh  and it wasn’t funny but i was mirthfully enjoying the experience  i was expecting to be bored  i was like i have a feeling what this is going to be about  but you forget how satisfying it is to have security watching the main character and knowing they are going to be a straight fucking boss  it gets rid of the stress watching some films  i truly truly enjoyed it  i will choose 4 swords for this movie  i would have probably chosen 5 balls without the voiceover  the voiceover threw me off  in retrospect if i could watch this without the voice over  there were some scenes… that would be tight 

i m going to review this movie  i enjoyed watching in a sense that if i was watching it with you guys the whole time we would be having shit to say  i was like oh my god what the fuck am i watching  the eye rolls  i was thinking of you guys watching this movie  the movie was absolute garbage and to be honest the comical level of male gaze   i couldn t clean myself of the grime that was so 2001  i think it was a great unit of measure to rate this movie out of and sense there was 1 in the movie  i ll rate this 1 denim pant hats  hat pants  got it  
shag   the car owner  the fact they make fun of a black person who thinks hes black and tx and dmx like segall wrote that scene 

 i want there to be a black guy who is like not all black guys are black  but sometimes white guys are black 

ok  so i watched this movie with allison  and like it was a trip  starts off with just crazy machine gun on helicopter in detroit  full on terrorist attack gunning down cops left and right  seagal with his goofy ass truck in an ice cream truck  then its like a buddie cop movie  he saves the vp from terrorists and they are like firing him  i felt like i watched 10 movies and none of them were good  there were a couple grousome deaths that were shocking and 2 funny deaths by impalment at the end  a steal tub cuts through the wall and the steam pipes   why don t you let off some steam   this what if this movie had more 1 liners 
i would say it was good to watch while drunk and it was boring in a lot of ways  i have to give it 2 heroin starchy shirts 
go down flarncoin     i command you    

this movie was disgusting in the truest sense  i think sam said that the something about dude who did horror movies in this style might be a reference to this  i did pick up on the underlying idea that it was supposed to be fun and the manic chaotic type funny humor  like eric andre  it s similar but like for some reason i wasn t able to enjoy the humerous aspects as i was watching it  i would like to believe  like i almost feel disappointed in myself  if watching a movie  if your reaction to watching a movie is running a race then i almost dropped out of the race on this one  it feels almost embarrassing at this point having listened to the conversation  i ve never been so put off of a movie that i thought i couldn t finish it until yesterday  i really didn t like it  i have to give it  i have to read myself in a way  fuck  i have to give it zero puckering dancing airbreathing buttholes 
i think i made it clear i liked this movie  i tried to listen to what everyone had to say  you guys are really good at breaking info down live  so being able to listen to you guys talk about it is like watching it again  watching it through a lens that has more depth to it seeing new perspectives that i didn t notice  if i didn t like it i have no problem blabbing on and on about my dipshit  when i enjoyed all ove it  it kind of dragged on at the end  in any normal viewing i would have been busting out laughing  but for this i was just like ok  maybe i was just oversaturated  reguardless this convo was amazing  its interesting hearing both sam and shaggy  they have a bunch of shit going on and they aren t looking forward to it but when you make the time for it it just makes it so fucking worth it  thats how i ve felt these past couple weeks  i basically want to give this  not a perfect movie by any means  but   allison interupts with june    i m going to give this movie 4 hotdog tonights  jesus  i don t remember what its called  titty biker gang killer super duper killers 
i knew about this movie but i d never scean it  i knew about it  i heard about it when i was younger in grade school and friends were allowed to watch it but i wasn t allowed to watch r rated movies for obvious reasons  remember when you would talk about a movie and that was your way of telling a joke  like it was something racy  i remember someone telling a storie about a 3 nippled woman who can tell the future and i remember imagining this scene and laughing so much about it  even hearing a person talk about that part in the movie was breaking ground with me  i was laughing because i didn t know what to do in that situation  soi that s all i got with my prioors with this  also i made a short film that i named after this movie   it was more literal in it s imagery  because it had an actual rat in it  watching this movie was  i definitely did the thing where the expectiations were so totally insane  the scene at the beginning where the main character tells a woman she would look fat on tv and she swamuntil she died  like it set me up for something crazy  some of the 90s humor just doesn t land for me  there were parts where i found it interesting but wasn t laughing but other parts where i would laugh out loud  i actually enjoyed watching the movie  i liked the monologue at the end to the cround where broadie just steals the show  i was made uncomfortable about a 15 year old talking about sex  i can see how that subplot was sex positive  but it made me feel uneasy  maybe that s ok  but it made me feel uneasy  some of these characters were in high school and some in college  i guess i didn t really enjoy it that much  i don t owe it anything  but i m going to be honest  i m going to go ahead and be honest and give it 2 chocolate ass palms with a pretzel 
this movie i watched it over the course of a couple days  i thought it was interesting and fun sometimes but it was unsatisfying a lot of the times  i ll try to be breif  i pretty much aggree with what everyone said  sam s review was the funniest and i think jordans was the most to the point but at the end of the day you have to give the 2 male performers credit so you have to give them 2 hit recaads 


ok  well i reccommended this movie and i did it because i was like feeling kind of blue about not being able to play maraton or oldboy  movies are hard to watch sometimes  i need to get better about knowing that in advance  i ve always wanted to watch battlefield earth because it s famous for being dumb and hilariously bad  it s just so derivative of stuff that had come before it  it s a joke  but only a joke to you  i enjoyed watching this moive  it s terrible  it s one of the most crazily bad movies i ve ever seen  it was a crazy fun movie to watch with alison  i needed that  there have been some movies that haven t been fun to watch  i was watching this movie and laughing my ass off  i was massaging her back and i felt the muscle relax  i truely believe this movie deserves 5 psychlo gynocyders  
so lets see here  hplly this is funny i always give the longest reviews  first i weant to say thank you for attending the first episode of season 10  this movie was really fun to watch  i really enjoyed watching whitney houston and i liked watching loretta devine go apeshit  i also thought the movie sounded really good  it was putting out nice sounds except the sex scenes  i really just enjoyed watching the entire film  i m going to give it 4 enduring friendshipts 

sam holly don t be fooled  this is reif trying not to show his ass to you 
i liked this movie a lot  it was suprising that i hadn t seen it because it seems like something i would have been into  i feel like i saw time crime at the same time  this was pc  post college   anyways  i really fucking liked this movie but i think it would have been better if it started with out the exposition and started with the bar scene   like before they get into the cray part of that scene  they play with this really ununual customer and locked in bartender  really cool thikg  anyway i m going to give it 4 burnt up faces  4 flaming hot cheetos  
4 dads
i liked this movie it was enjoyable to watch and it was weird to watch cause there were parts that werte hard to follow super well  i liked the guy was called an economist  it was funny  i was trying to explain this movie and i was like it was so hard to explain the plot because i didn t know who anyone was  some of the people were criminals anf some were citizents  it was like citizerns and good citizend  it was like a comedy of errors  there were parts wher i laughed and parts where i was confuseedd  weird cuts and speed ups so i m just going to give it 3 robes with mother of pearl buttons 
jordan shag and i were talking about this but shag was saying he hadn t seen it  i  too  had not seen the full movie  i d seen some of it on cartoon network  i felt like it was in many ways disappointing to what i was expecting  but  when the joker showed up i was just laughing my ass off  stone cold sober laughing  because of the whole manic lunacy of the joker and mark hamill going 100  i was going to give it three but i m giving it 4    what did we score it    batarangs

bossanova is that a music type  there isn t much i can say that hasn t been said  i think the jokers girllfriend was my favorite part and julie andrews was my 2nd favorite part and the boady guard was my 3rd favorit part and the detective getting his finger smashed was my 4yth favorite part  if they would have ended the movie on the bed it would have been good but it gets 3 normas small rages 
i enjoyed watching this movie and was bummed i couln t watch it on the tv but i got to wear headphones  you know i lol s at a bunch of the jokes watching it by myself but if i was watching this with someone else  we would have been watching like crazy  i pretty much agree with everyone but my sentiment leans toward ryan s  so for that i ll give it 3 melted beer can hands 
yea this movie was pretty weird but i enjoed it  some parts i was bored and confused  i think i would have enjoed this more in a group  enjoed this convo  i was going to give it a 2 or 3 but by the end of the convo i think this gets 4 cigarettes 
its like this move it needs to jam it down so it comes back up at you  so i think that s a good start to the way i felt about this movie  it was just their for 1 hour and 1 minute  then when bones became flesh it started and i enjoed that part  the effects  the spooky wall were good  i agreed with everyone so no point inrecreating the wheel  i thought that snoop was tight as a presence but he wasnt in it that much  i give it 2 spooky maggot showers   rain maggots    2 spooky rain maggot houses 

so  yea i feeel like i agree with most of the sentiments here  the scene shark vs  zombie definitely the highlight of the movie for me  without that scene this would be 1 tis out scuba divers  but with it it gets 2 tits out scuba divers 
so  i m drinking natural light naturdays right now  i ve had like 4 of these so far  it s the perfect night to drink these  i watched this fucking movie and it is basically the equivalent to one of these  total garbage  but i ve had 4 of them and i m not going to say i ve enjoed them but there is a lot of sugar in them and it masks the bad flavor and this movie has a lot of tiddies which masked the attrociiousness of it  i m going to give this 1 pussy train to pussy town 
i ll review the movie i picked  last time i saw this was 10 years ago with aaron whitwer  it was his favorite movie  i took it very seriously and at the end i was shocked  10 years ago  i hadn t watched movieds anywhere close to this movie  i did my very best to be polite about it but i was honest about it  i didn t really want to talk much about it  i was just like  that movie was really crazy  i remember the conversation being awkward  this 2nd time watching it i really enjoyed it alot  i thought it was interesting and intense  um  and funny at times  which i think is just  it was funny to talk about the funny parts of the movie  i liked it alot so i m going to give it 4 trash feathers 
let me review this movie now  i think i didn t watch this with allison  she loves cathy bates  but i didn t know she was in it  i didn t know the dad from elf was in it  so  overall i thought it was good  it had a beauty and the beast vibe  but like beauty was like the beast and the beast was like the guy  but like the beauty was the beast and the beauty from beauty of the beast was james cain 4
i thought this movei was pretty boring actually  for a lot of the reasons brought up on the negative sider  thought it was going to be a mystery  but it was just a guy who lived across the street and went to kilill her and got killed by 1 almost grabbed shard of glass 
ok um  so i watched this on my computer which i enjoed because i could put on my headphones  a lot of times on my computer i get distracted but i closed everything down and only watched it on my big screen  that contributed to my enjoyment of the film and i for a while i would try to write fdown the characters and places and know the name of things  this time i did that  i think it contributed to me enjoying the movie because it helped me make sense of the chaos  if i wasn t paying attention i wouldn t have understood the movie at all  it was a very fast movie and there were songs where i wouldn t have known why they were happening  because of all that i was able to experience it for what it was which was kind of a crazy wild you know what i got kind of holy mountain vibes from it  like going from place to place and lingering in places with some lunacy you aren t really supposed to make sense of but enjoy it  it was just similar to bringing me back to the roots of movie club so i m going to give it 4 beef 
ok  this movie was pretty fun to watch  i d never seen any orson wells movies  i knew his name because id heard it a bunch and was in citizen kane  i remember vaguly hearing orson wells and thinking that it was george orwwell and thinking george orwell was in cinima because of that  i was called a dumb fuck  that was my only memory of orson wells  which is kind of embarassing to say because he is kind of a pillar in the american cinematic universe  so cool  i thought he didnt do a very good irish accent  but i didn t know if he was actually irish  i didn t want to judge him because maybe that was his real voice  and um  i thought the movie was fun  rita hayworth was amazinly attractive and a great presence on screen in general  if that cliff diving was her that was great  the end was fun and crazy and boonkers  i think i like this movie quite a bit more than average so i have to give it 4 close up swearty grisbys 
i have first i am just shocked at the lukewar   it seemed like this movie wasn t super popular  having to do with cronenberg and the expectations that it s cronenberg and the shrough of william s borroghs  i don t know anything about william so i took this totally at face value  i know who cronenberg is and the fly and the references in rick   morty with the accident on earth where everyone is sexually attracted to morty and there is a love potion and they try to fix it but everyone on earth becomes bugs and so then thats my understanding of like  the first time i saw that i didn t know what cronenberging someone meant  what does it mean to cronenberg something  so i came in with that  i thought it was sick  this movie was super crazy and fun to watch  the giant beetles were gross but kinda cute in there own way  i felt attached to clark nova and when he was killed i was sad  at first i was abhorred when clark nova was eating the other typewriter but then i thought that was kind of cute as well  i wrote down more notes on this movie than i have in ages  the fact he killed his wife and lover in the same way  i thought the ending was kind of obtuse for my puny brain  i have to look past the ending and its just all the things that come together for me to have to give this 5 sips from a mugwump jism 
so  i have seen this movie but i came to this realization that i saw it in reverse when i saw it this time the last scene where they are debating shooting the guy in the arm  i saw that scene first  i was pretty young maybe 7th grade  you know like  my parents had a big cable package with all the movie channels like starz and cinemax  so aft i was done working on the farm i d flip through the movie channels  i popped in while they were debating shooting the guy  interesting little tid bit  i thought this movie was pretty good but not as good as it could be so i m giving it 3 crusty herbal remedies for ya boy 
my day was pretty interesting  i got called a racist because i had to ask a guy if he had supporting documentation for the precious artifiacts that were stolen from his store  and he was like oh you won t believe that i owned this because you re racist  but i couldn t help  there was a snow storm today  6 inches in 1 hour  it toook alison 2 hours to get home  i took jean to a bar and had beer and jean had a hotdog  my day was pretty decent 

i thought this movie was pretty good  it was on par in terms of intensity with druk  but it had more limitations  i felt druk was slightly more cohesive  from my heart i feel like druk deservs a 5 and this deserves 4 retarded arms 
so  i agreed with a lot of the reviews  i picked up on that maybe johnson was digging the movie more than most and digging tom more than most  myabe i was smitten by tom a bit  he wasn t as blatent in his cofidence as the movie was trying to seem  the positive at the end that noone ended up together was good  the dumbest shit ever was the final conflict where this woman loves this man but finds out that he kind of got himself into a more emotional state to get that shot was the domino that shattered evertyhrting  maybe because her view of him was poiseened because aaron said he was the devil  i thought that was the dumbest shit ever and i hated it  they didn t gend up together which i think was the right call so instead of getting 1 concentrated screwdrivers it gets 2 concentrated screwdrivers  and budweiser 
um  i thought this movie was um pretty good 

i thought that the female lead character reminded me a bit of stephanie densberger with her distrust of the whole establishment thing 

mant  was tight 

um oh yeah  um the shopping cart movie was super cool  because the shopping cart was like a little doggy  and there was paint and cake splatter everywhere 

overall john goodman was great and the male lead gene was also great 

ill give this one a 3 shopping cart unlces 
okay um i liked this movie in the second half but didn’t expect to be so bored in the first half 

the movie was actually more visually drab than i expected 

thus  im going to give it a 3 crown brands as entry passes to recursive clubs 


i really liked melanie griffiths character because she kept saying  c mon charlie   but that s not enough to carry a movie  specially one with such a scary guy 

thus  it gets a 3 virginia lubber t shirts 
okay so i enjoyed watching this movie with alison  but i also thoght it was pretty bad and weird  because there is one flawless cgi titty cup in the movie  it deserves one flawless cgi titty cup 
so i watched this movie  thought it was pretty good for parts but also fell asleep at the end 

mike meyers is a goofball  which is great but also has it s drawbacks 

cop guy was great and liked to see his genuine laughter talking to scottish dad mike meyers 

everyone said everything that needed to be said  not great  but not terrible movie 

im gonna give this movie 2 womans and 0 woooooooooo mans   2 units 

if you couldn’t tell  i liked this movie  i liked how it had all of the 1 two punch things   where she disses the clothes girl  so any ways the hotel manager was awesome and the guy in the elevator  julia roberts  hair 

i personally believe that this movie deserves 4 steamy horse divits 
hot doggy 

i liked this movie the first time  but liked it more the second time 

other things were said  i think that my um  thoughts are quite well known after this great conversation 

thus  5 hands stuck inna god mouth 
ummmmmm

well this movie was had a huuuuuge cast 

and um  thanks to ryan for recommending this movie that felt like  at least to me it was from the late 90s  i was thinking about how the matrix came out in 1999 and then this movie came out 6 years later  how weird 

um  every one said all the stuff that i was mostly thinking  so lets just get this over with 

i didnt like the end but i thought the beginning and middle were pretty cool  but i really didnt like it all that much  gonna give it 2 cucumbers in gardners butt 

anyways  um dakota johnson pretty awesome but maggie gylenhaal was even more awesome 

i liked maggie and the way she portrayed her character so much that i gotta  against all odds and criticism  i gotta give this movie 4 paddle smacks in the bafroom 
okay without further adoe  lemme review this pooty poo 

i did not really like this movie all that much i thoguth the soundrack made me very sleepy 

the action was good at the beginning okay in th emiddle and bad at the end even though there was more of it at the end 

jennifer connely was very sexy 

alan arkin pretty good 

and there was a giant  which i thought was kinda dumb 

john locke the guy from lost  he s in this   he s the founder of the company my dad used to work for 

youall probably konw where im going with this  here we go  2 slices of pepins famous gum 
ummm  i too have seen this movie  it was worse the second time 

2 cheeky lil abrams boxes 
i don’t have like a ton to say about it 

the end part on the train when momma s face was gonna get smashed and head decapitated never happened so that bummmmmed me out 

but the flip book was tight  so it gets a 2 mr guys coffee table books of 100 girls i d like to pork 
johnson  i did love the barkeep looking at the window and getting swindled   hey i think i been swindled 

kevin  charles grodin woulda presented himself as mosley 

jordan  cause local police came out and like eyyy wadda you talkin bout  that woulda taken a week in 1987 

hake  mosley got fired at the end of the movie 

jordan  hes a grifter man  he s a fake 

hake  he busts serrano at the end 

johnson  pointers about serrano  good to feel like a cop again  fbi was like  this all goes straight you gotta job 

hake  groden loses deniro to marvin  the the guy behind the diner counter serving him coffee was in repo man the weirdo with the one line i remember  john wayne guy  always burning trash and talking about time travel in repo man 

sam  i didnt see repo man dawg  i left before everyone watched it  i was not listening til someone heard my name 

hake  repo man on the table for the chucklefucks 

sam  im embarrassed i havent seen this movie 

hake  i feel embarrassed cause these guys dont know what im talkin bout shhhhh 

jordan  only thing i recognize is from repoman 

ryan  my experience watching repoman was we were outdoors and people were talking over it 

    

yeah so since i said alll that stuff about repo man  im gonna go with 4 non counterfeit counterfiet 20s 
i thought this movie had a lot violence and strong bullets and strong bodies 

i also thought that the version i watched had interesting font for the subtitles  that was pretty cool 

most of the cantonese seemed to be dubbed over  i think called adr  it kinda messed with my head a bit  and i dont know where im going with this 

i liked it but too long  3 day saving little piss pots 
okay 

i watched this movie on my phone  yes the same phone that s now busted  i watched before it was busted 

laughter 

i thought this movie was trying to be something that it wasn’t and therefore i didn’t really enjoy it all that much 

however  the scene where the general kills all the un truck was my favorite  and so it gets 2 cancelled safe space peas and carrots 
i wrote down this quote and it goes like this 

 you are responsible for what you do 

okay  and that was the thing the prison guard said to henry  and that really showed how important it is to be reeducated 

no but for real  this movie had a huge impact on me the first time i saw and i really enjoyed it and looked past a lot of the weird shit even the second  well this was the third time  i saw it 

4 turds in a bowl 
i really think that this movie was a lot of fun to watch 

rick and um  the other guy  they were both great  except i knew that rick was in movies i had seen before 

so that gave him more points 

regardless  of all that  we can say for certain that hake is a great guy  who picked a great and funny one  it really warmed my sould to know the he was driving across america watchin this movie on a fuckin vhs 

good one hake  this gets 5 two minute pisses on a looney bin from this guy 

sensing 

all of those reviews gave me a ton of joy 

im so happy that i got to share this movie with all of you  either for the first or second 4 tayes diggss faces on a marble lfoor 
okay ill review this movie  i think that the subplot with harriet bird and memo pariso could have been fleshed out a bit more and that bummed me aout a bit 

i think that it would have been cooler if roy hobbs only hit homeruns 100  of the time  but otherwise it was was pretty great and i wish i had his haircut 

4 tiny little poison morsel tartlets from me 

so ill review this 

i think i agree with pretty much everyone about most of the stuff we talked about 

loved the practical effects and puppeteering  loved the voice acting and thought steve martin was awesome in the way he got eaten by the hero 

the hero of this movie was audry ii and it s clones 

the destruction of the human race was it s goal  and it succeeded  and its a damn shame that the actual plot of the movie was not known by most moviegoers of this film 

ima give this one a 4 glitterly lily funeral arrangements 
i watched this movie on my birthday 

i asked alison if i could watch this movie on my birhday and make a cake and um eat indian food  and we had a great time 

jean watched the first hour  then she had to go to bed  then we watched the last 40 minutes 

this movie was very serious  i thought it was going to be more goofy 

i also thought it was very goofy  and not as serious as i thought it would be 

such a paradox  paradoxes are pretty tight  and so is this movie  i give uncle buck 4 gnat eating circumcisms 
office space  rules 

i watched this on comedy central 

i don t konw how i old i was when this came out  this movie is pretty tight  it had an actual impact on my career  not good  

i think its hilarious its really good i like this movie you guys should like this movie too   4 bobs 
um  i liked it  but i also thought it should have been called the kung fu kid 

pretty lame if you ask me 

jaden was pretty good  i thought the girl was pretty good  so that is where i disagree with everyone 

too much agression in the competition  didnt make sense to me 

so it gets 3 jackets off with attitude 
i watched watched this by myself and i actually thought it was more enteratining than i expected it to be 

um but it still really sucked badly  with the action and acting and script  so ill gvie it 2 space roller blades  gotta get those differential equations

 dhoom  2004  is a classic bollywood film that has all the elements of a typical bollywood movie  drama  action  and song and dance  however  for me personally  the movie didn t quite live up to the hype 

the story revolves around a police officer named jai dixit and his sidekick ali akbar fateh khan  who set out to capture a ruthless biker thief named kabir  the plot was predictable and at times  a little too over the top for my taste  the acting was decent  but nothing particularly outstanding 

one of the highlights of the movie for me were the action scenes  particularly the high speed bike chase  they were well choreographed and definitely added some excitement to the film  however  the frequent song and dance numbers were not really my cup of tea and often felt out of place in the story 

although i didn t find the movie particularly engaging  i did find myself laughing at some of the more humorous moments in the film  overall  while i wouldn t say that dhoom is a must watch  it is still an entertaining film that fans of bollywood movies may enjoy  

i give this movie a 2 sunglasses 
i had to watch this movie on my phone  but actually my phone has a pretty good screen so it wasn t that bad 

i also had headphones on while watching it  which is awesome  cause the soundtrack and sound effects ruled 

i really liked it  i liked how simple the story was  it was clearly a love story between two outcasts that wanted to be incasts 

4 cursed elongated arms  got it 
watched this with jean and alison  alison was constantly confused about why the hell it had nothing to do with mario  she kept being like  wait  that s in mario   

jean really liked yoshi and just kept saying  where s the baby dinosaur       

um  if yoshi would have eaten lena  woulda been 5 screamin martini worms  but instead it is 4 screamin martini worms i loved this movie 
it was fun to watch this with jean because she was soooooo hype on the dinosaurs  4 circuses which have the notion of some spiiiiiiiiiieeece 
the same 

the same old song 

dededededeedeeedeeed  the same  same old song  deeededeeededededede 

deedededeeedeedjfoasdijfpaosedifjaopsdifjasdopfjiopjasdfiojsdfaiojsdfaiojasdfojifasdiojasdfjiopsdfjiosdfaiasdfiopjasdfjiopasdfioasdfiojarfjioasfdiopjasdfojipasdfiojasdfjioasdfjioasdfiojasdfjio asdfjioasdfjioasdfujioasdfojiasdfiojasdfjioasdfoujiasdfjio asdfujioasdfjioasdfujio 

that s my review  this movie was boooooorrrrrrrrrrrriinnnnnnnnngggggg until the end  so it gets 2 juicy  wet  curdled gallons o milko  
i saw this twice in 2023  and both times kinda liked it  i thought it had a subversive but not subversively benign enough ending  so it gets 3 multi gold medal winning exact replicas of michael phelpses 

 clyde   
very early in the movie we meet clyde  he s an orangutang  after we meet him  he shares a beer with clint eastwood  this movie is absolutely insane 

 fights   
there s lots of fighting in this movie  where clint eastwood is either outsized or outnumbered  clint eastwood always beats up the people he is fighting and wins without really needing to put in much effort 

 ma   
clint eastwood s character has a crazy mom who has some sort of running gag regarding her ability to drive 

 the black widows   
clint eastwood starts a fight with the local neo nazis  and they are trying to kill him  he also starts a fight with skyler  the singer lady s boyfriend  who alsow ants to kill him 

 bar fights   
this movie kind of reminds me of that other movie we watched this season with all the bar fights there s lots of bar fights in this movie  at least 2 big ones  alright  less than half way through the movie  the neo nazis  cops  and a shotgun weilding crazy guy are trying to kill clint 

 on the road   
now our adventurers have picked up a lady on the way to find the other lady  a monkey  two brothers and a lady named echo are riding in a truck 

 neo nazis at the diner   
there is a very weird scene at a diner where the neo nazis walk into a diner and then fight a bunch of the patrons outside  then after the fight  a cop driving a semi truck runs over one of the neo nazi s motorcycles  then    i guess the patrons help the neo natzi s escape  i don t really know  i guess the cops are worse than neo nazi s in this world 

the vibe of this movie is offputting and strange  vulgar  agressive  violent  filled with unnecessary and unexplaind destruction 

 mas yard   
there is an awesome scene where the neo nazis drive their motorcycles all around the yard of clint eastwood s mom  and then she pulls out a shotgun and blows up a bunch of their motorcycles  they brought it upon themselves by destroying here porch 

 harmonizing at the bar   
later on we see the singer lady out at a new bar signing with a guy  they are harmonizing and i have now idea how they make that sound but it s reaaal nice 

 clint on the town with orangutang   
clint eastwood takes the orangutang out on the town drinking beers  and goes to a couple of strip clubs  it s pretty bizzare  they walk passt the same storefront a couple times  i think they are supposed to be in denver at this point  i don t really know  we are slightly past halfway  and now the movie is starting to get a bit boring 

 orangutang sex   
when clint get s back from a night on the town with his orangutang  he goes on a sort of tirade and needs to get out of town  he s upset that clyde the organgutang doesn t have a lady orangutang to like   make love with   so he takes clyde to the fucking zoo 

clyde goes into the orangutang enclosure and finds a female  shuts the door  and there s the implication that clyde just had sex with the female 

 fight at meatpacking plant   
there s a common theme about some legendary figher tank murdock    apparently tank is just as good as our hero clint eastwood  anyways  we arrive at a high intensity feed lot   meat packing plant combo  where orville has arranged clint eastwood to fight some guy who  stacks up to tank murdock   because our crew is running low on cash 

the fight ensues  and it starts off like clint is being cautious because the fight might be close  but then clint just completely obliterates this guy  actually  i take it back  turns out you can take a lot of shots to the face in this world  and cheat  the guy grabs a meathook and tries to actually kill clint eastwood with the meathook  then the bookie who set up the fight is like  we aint gonna pay yous fools  but then the lady from the national lampoons movies actually pulls out a six shooter revolver and shoots one of the carcasses hanging near the asshole who was trying to con our heros 

 campsite   
clint goes for a run at the campsite in the mountains  there was also a bowling and a scene with the cops earlier  and a scene where nancy is in daisy dukes and doing some bowling 

clint actually ran into nancy on his run  and mentions that she didn t even get a chance to meet clyde  there is perhaps some funny busines going on with nancy  she doesn t seem at all excited to see clint 

then they have sex  in a hotel  in the truck  i dunno  she seems to be conning filo 

 fly fishing   
the cops finally meet up with philo and the gang  he s caught some fish and they are going to kill him with shotguns  seems a bit unnecessary 

fucking rattlesnake 

the cop is going to apparently blow philo s head off with a shotgun  but sees that philo caught a very large fish  so instead of doing that  he starts helping philo with instructions on how to reel the fish in    then philo gives the cop the fishing rod and    when the fish is reeled in he smacks the cop in the face with the fish  and then punches out the other cop who was oddly sent around the lake as backup  then he sinks the truck of the cops 

 mountain town   
we arrive in a mountain town  the nazis have met up with lynn and they discuss the matter of philo betto  lynn confirms that she doesn t really like philo  then philo rolls in and has a showdown with the neo nazis  he  predictably  kicks everyone s asses 

this movie kind of has a  warriors  vibe  like the costumes and the way everyone is kind of archetypal  orville hijacks a forklift dumptruck and then smashes all of the neo nazi s bikes  this movie is like    way too long 

 dancing charlie rich lounge   
more singing at a bar  it will likely result in some sort of big fight sequence  i m ready for this  but honestly it s been enough  or maybe just some good music  mr  charlie rich signing some good songs 

then we see lynn walk outside and kiss the guy she was signing with and she says  knight me   want me  and she is caught  the moment of reckoning 

this confrontation culminates in a violent outburst by lynn where she beats on clint and his face becomes bloodied  it is quite the spectacle 

 another fight   tank murdoch   

clint eastwood ha fighting shoes  they are actually running shoes  lol  brother at the start of the fight says  dont worry about it philo  guys a real porker 

all of these fights have people not using any sort of guard  how come nobody uses their hands to protect themselves from getting punched in the face  such a weird thing 

clint eastwood  predictaibly beats the crap out of tank murdoch  he s now punched tankin the face like 30 times in a row  that s gotta be a game over  3 knockdowns  4 knockdowns 

even though clint beats the crap out of tank murdoch  he throws the fight and gets punched to the ground  i think he threw the fight because he was feeling all sad about chasing that lady down 

i also don t really understand what the deal was with that guy hustling lynn or whatever  this movie has no point  this movie is i guess a seinfeld episode sort of movie 

final verdict  not great  really weird  incredibly unsatisfying ending    kind of funny  kind of annoying  crappy fight scenes  good country music  and um    yeah i think this movie was just okay  also the orangutang part was really weird
