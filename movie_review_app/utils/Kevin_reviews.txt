i can t believe a kid s movie like this exists  how do you deal with things like this in modern times 
new comfort movie  zina agrees 

i felt cheated at the end of the movie  maybe that s the point but i don’t feel like the movie delivers that successfully  the jokes are great  i enjoyed spending time with these people but its almost like they don’t care about their dead friend at all  so well made  got sucked along from moment to moment  it goes down easy  i know my parents have recommended  come up empy handed  2 dead kevin costners   2 5 at most

made me question reality  the casting of brett gelman was awesome he was absolutely fantasitc and i really enjoyed the how like so mundane it was presented and just like yeah man this is what working gigs are out here and its just like absolutely nothing whateverbody said i agree with it was fun and funny
i did enjoy this movie  while its heavily flawed i was like  damn dude there s tities and guns everywhere 
im like sam  my dad wants me to watch this movie  new it was about a boxer who killed a guy goes back to ireland for the first time  such a spoiler  it was a spoiler  as im watching it i was like okay this is not the typical john wayne movie  which is interesting  i laughed my ass off at this movie  i was charmed by it  like i was in the story  i thought the relationship dynamic between john wayne  while troublesome  i wont defend the sexual politics  i thought itw as interesting for the era  characters more nuanced maureen ohara i was in love with her the whole movie  my favorite john wayne performance  looks at wrecked bed   homeric  lol  5 spiked cigarettes 
the framing device is my biggest hangup  won me over by the end  im tearing up in the final scene between girl and old man  happy reif picked movie and introduced to worl dof lil prince  wanna read book now  1970s version live action musical  its definitely not as good as the animated version  heres the thing  the snake is played by bob fauci  the snake dance inspired michael jackson to do billy jean  what  i want to visit it
man  i thank you so much for making me watch this movie  this was a religious movie for me  i have found a new low in cinema to go to  you meant like in the catholic iconography  this movie spoke to me as a former catholic trying to become a buddhist i fucking got it man  to give me the perfect tv pilot to boot  this movie fucking sucked  it was amazing  by my rating 1 better than bruce lee  1 un  bruce lees but betters  lol
i felt like chidi in the good place  the poetry is kinda cool  its kinda cool  i was trying to connvice myself  it wuuld work in a song  it fucking doesn’t  after this movie wsa done  i had already erased it from my brain  ed harris in black face  lol  what the fuck o my god this actually fucking happen  i stan a king in dillon  this covo is amazing lol fucking zero stars
i m mad now that i gave masked and anonymous zero stars  that’s an appropriate response  proved me wrong  don’t want to eat a dimple pie don’t want to hand out a dimple pie 
i dunno i loved this movie  it hits a sweet spot its fun im with reif the pacing is king of weird still enjoy it wisht he movie nails deeper themes its trying to hit a little better but in the scope of a fun 95 minute science fiction action romp it does   it it  it comes to choose  chew bbble cums and 4 pairs of snc
yeah  i so having seen this movie previously knowing the broad beats im gonna watch this and like  there  first time i watched when the ending hit i had a reaction to it  it’s a bout a man who horry emotion  second time i was like trying to watch it and it almost drove me fucking out of my mind  i dont remember anything that going on  drive me up a wall trying to figure out whats going on  ending gave hard gut punch  movie drags  satisfying ending wrap up in aemotional way belw my mind having seen 4 liks of d sutherlands toothpaste mustaceh
i ve seen this movie before  wanted to recommend it to try and float a rec that is good  wanna see how it holds up  the conversation did not disappoint  i loved this movie  it s such a fun thriller  you got the conspiracy angle  young travolta  young lithgow  depalma  my fave depalma  analog porn  movie porn  they dont make movies like this anymore  funny accent   man   pause  glad shaggy gave 5  4 screams  thassa good scream   good screems 
i thought i had an impression of this movie going in  feared it would be what i though tit would be  sam thoguth maybe i gave it a 3 but he gavie it a 2  despite the studio this movie to me weirdly has personality 

i m glad it exists  i can see myself watchin this movie  oh yeah this is a tight genre movie from the 2010s  i wish it had more  giving it 3 rotten sons of bitches 

wyatt wheels gas cannister to have it shoot it hero moment doesnt kill him but you gotta fuckin shoot this thing man 
seen this movie before 

we were out throwing disc golf over the weekend i was like  yeah this is amovie i have seen and i was like… this is not my kind of movie 

i don’t hate what this movie is doing  i almost recommend it as a horror movie even though myself i dont necessarily like it  i like what it is going for  man this second watch was rough in a like  this is horrifying  i dont like subjecting myself to this movie again  2 eaten bloody hearts out of a hand 
i watched the first one  it explained nothing  watched the second one  well  it didn’t explain anything more  i enjoyed it for what it was  mad max meets evil dead  the evil dead stuff i loved  especially coming before army of darkness 

it felt a little directionless which everything that was thrown at me  okay were doing this now  okay were doing this now  it was just a little clunky for me  its the strongest 3 i can give it  3 quad shotguns  tri quad dough  a tri qualled quest
i watched this two hours ago  it ive seen it before  it    was its such a i dunno its actually just a really nice documentary 
this movie made me realize that i kind of bought into the cult of arnold hook line and sinker  if this was the red pill  i m 100  convinced watching it  of course dude this guy went on to be the biggest fuckin action star  when he dies i will cry 
rest of the movie  its cool watching body building but like  arnold is the real star of this movie 
but
since its not my favoritye  4 types of people who are the types of dogs who would bite back 
jordan  close 
yeah  i  uh its good movie  good time for movies 99 great movie  this was made in 99 and it’s a great move and 4 juicy fruits in a fishbowl that i reach in and grab 
gotta be honest  struggled last night  nope  not for me  hita  wall  kinda love we did the 2000s weird digital gross aesthetic  i don’t like it  not for me  weird choice 

this conversation changed my opinoin  improved it a bit  not much    so gotta go 2  money  fame success glamour 

dillon mcdermitt i have fun with my friends sums up this movie in conversation in way
when i was a boy of 12  11  11  i wanted to see this movie in the theatres and we went to the theatres that day  this was the first pg 13 movie i was gonna see in the theatres on my own  didn’t happen cause the movie my mom wanted to see was sold out  had to rent  i fuckin loved it  watched it a billion times  i loved it  its what everyone else said  interesting movie for being 2000  you see where the modern blockbuster is going  honestly there was a time where i did not like it and thought it was bad but now i dont  i still ove it  3 lazer cut poopy dog keys that you get your jollys off on  i get my jollys off on 

jordan  dont put that off on us man 

sam  you fuckin sicko
comin hot off the grid i watched and fell asleep after 20 mins i was bored out of my fucking mind oh so boring 

sex  and stuff and boring  it sucked to look at at and malkoviz was weird and i lovd him so 2 of his double wigs you fucking idiot 

hot take hake my ass 
 sam puts his shirt back on 

ready reif 

so  yeah  i like i was torn i wanted to do a bond movie forever and i was torn between this one and moonraker 

but 

w  sean connery passing i felt very compelled to do this one  there is just nuttiness and campiness in this one and it is crazy  as far as shitty bonds go  and i think sam hit the nail  it is farily borning 

i never liked this as a kid  i thought it sucked 

holy shit tho if the moonbuggy chase and this dude this is prolly this is close to the stinkiest of the bonds  im gonna give it 1 moonbuggywithplentyottoole

boy 

so um  i played minor league ball  this movie took me back tow hen i played minor leauge ball 

i played with a bunch of st johns friends  when i played i played catcher a lot as a mouthy little kid 

the ump pulled me aside because my mouth was too much for him 

my dad coached the team and he showed me the bad news bears

i had not seen it in 20 years  iiiit popped 

took me back to when i was a kid  this movie tug at my heart strings  he put in all the 2nd string kids at the end 

dude i fuckin loved this movie it gets 5 cruds 

 sheds a tear 

badnews bears walter mathoo
um 

alright 

so 

like sam i was ready for a movie like this  i i i wanted to give i wanted to give redfin a benefit of the doubut there was a lot i was able to enjoy but a the end of the day it just  it just  it just kinda sucked 

so  i stand with my boy sam two stars 

sam  i stand with my boy jordan  hake stands his boy sam 

hake  quote it 
hake

um i will keep it short and sweet this movie is relaxed and chill 

it shows australians are nice and cool 

i like how it comes full circle and he walks on peoples heads like they are crocodiles at the end 

3 froth off beer 
since i go next  im gonna get creative 

im not going to huse words  im goingt us use pictures 

 shows nixon thing 

twoooo spider monkeys 

jordan  let the record show he put up 4 

kevin  i was thratening him for the record

sam  give him your unit


these are cool songs but we got 6 minutes left 

or by the movie

uh no im teasin im just teasin  this was not the first time i seen this movie i watched it a while back cause i bought it for a buck off the shelf and i was like oh robert altman did this movie and i was gettign into his movies 

its charming  its solid it makes me laugh i can put this on its like a warm blanked movie

it makes me laugh
it makes me smile
it pulls on my heart strings

sandwich lady guy who dies song 

robert altman so much stuff like yeah that passed me by

4 failed rolled cigaretes by failed ckevin cline
ready 

django

um  yeah  i dunno  i i mean  i only picked this movie because i was forced to 1966  it was a weird year  a lot of art house not right for movie club 

django came out same year as the good the bad and the ungly  you can see how this one gets overshadowed  its riding on the coattails of that 

its a recylced plot that doesnt necessary succeed  the violence comes out the ears get cutoff the hands get smashed the theme song rips 

the last like  what 10 minutes of the movie was like what the fuck is gonna happen  i thought the movie was over  like jacksons gonna kill the mexicans and the racists wins and oh lets see this shit 

then you have the scene at the graveyard and its badass and the themesong kicks in and the fucking put the machine gun in coffin and took it out and filled it with gold so i gotta give it 4 of those for doin that 
this movie pretty cool  lot of cool things to look at 

this was one by the time it was finishing up  i kind of would like to watch this on the big screen  this movie does scale soooo well 

for all of its flaws  if i had seen this on a big screen i would have been like holy shit its flawed but its fucking amazing 

that first scene where the camera zooms out of the ziggurat and the zepplins and the title card 

fuck rock  fuck rock forever  rock is a fucker he should have died within 30 minutes of this movie 

dude  never have i ever wanted to reach through my tv screen and strangle a 2d dude 3 whatever the fuck fuck rock 3 uncles who dont giveashitabouttheirnephews 


this is a tough one cause this movie is only tied to childhood memories  this is just one of the first movies i remember seeing and making an implant on my brain and it was scary 

it was scary and it scared me and i was afraid that these martian aliens were going to come lazer me in my bed 

ever since then i have watched it and it was stuipd and it was fun 

shags new take blew my mind open and i also agree with everything jordan said 

i wish it was a tigher package  i wish we got more time with the martians fuckin with the planet  but yeah  we didnt  we got what we got so i give it 4 attacks by mars 
hesitates

this was an interesting pick  im glad i saw it  um  i like sex 

now that i have been having it  i think this movie just reinforces that idea that i should have more of it 

3 sex doctor balls vibes 
 eats pizza 

i wanna start off by saying  damn you guys really like this movie 

i wasn’t expeciting that  i was very grossed out the entire movie  from the get go  there was a part of me that i wanted to revisit this and i remember this movie being bizzare more than anything and only vaguely remember chris katan being rediculous and my kid brain loved it 

brendan frazier let me down  not good in this movie 

but it was wild  as gross as it was  theres plenty to look at theres a lot goign on here  holy shit that chris katan scene just thank fucking god it exists 

yeah 

im on the shag end  the chris katan elevates it from very gross to just okay bad gross to organs gorwing out of chris katan 
luise ck  i see a buncha little lawbreakers out there

i didn’t even understand what he was sying that scene 

legally they have to say this  they have to say  you gotta tocuh any body buncha lawbreakers in here 

if im goin  im goin  there was lis ck but watevs 

crush on girl in movie club and she was like you gotta watch the magic mike monie and i was like okay so i did and i was gonna try some ways to talk this girl up  whatever i could


so im like  so i watched magic mike  you watched the bad one  you watched the bad magic mike movie 

i havent seen the second one i disagree with her take this si a good movie and there is sexy male bodies and there is lame talk about financies and it comes together in an interesting way

steven soderburg i like and 14 catfulls of ghb
ill go next 

going off wat jordan said this is an interesting one sam spoke to it oo not just jordan  we all been talking about it 

i thought it straddled the line really well and it kinda walked that like  uh characters are responsible for themselves  its not the alchoohls fault it lead to the how the users leads to its onw concequences sort of thing 

i cant wait to see the american remake in 2 years starring 

john hamm
hannibul burress
jeremey renner
john hma

4 with a coin in front of my bee aayy cee 

i just picked a tag cast its just like what this movie was  i took a tag cast 

 everyone laughs a lot 


quick and simple  not knowing anything about this movie  i thought it was weirdly charming for a lo fi indy movie and i like… i was just happy that there are a bunch of not pretty looking actors in here  it just made it all the more enjoyable to watch  dean imperial for the win cast him in more movies i hope to see him in shitty cop roles for the next 20 years in all my hollywood action movies or burnt out mob dads or suburban dad with teenage daughter and doesnt want to go to prom with the weird art kids 3 exceptionally out of place pillow fights 
this is the
third time i saw this movie  i was excited to watch it first as i said at the top 

i dunno it was an interesting view and i remember watchign this movie at 22 and feeling like my mind was blown and you are in highschool and you just started seeing movies its arthouse and critically acclaimed like whoa this made me think so much and watching it this time its like oh yeah    this is an interesting idea that kinda just skims the surface and touches a lot of taboo subjects 

and it creates a reaction out of everyone but i feel like the movie doesnt necessarily have anything that its really trying to say on a deeper lever  but    the craft is there  i still loved it i think a lot of the humor  other than the tiger scene  crackles 

3 vagianaplastiesthatarenonconsentual
let me review this shit and then we can free form talk 

yeah so  i heard of sorcerer  it gets tossed around a lot on movies subreddit  its got this like… i has an aura around it it because its considered a lost hollywood film from its time  always been a lot of chatter around it  ive been interested in seeing 

when i saw the wages of fear and realized sorcerer was  remake iw as like cool  even cooler  i was very excited to watch this movie 

i really admire freidkin s apprach in his movies to just   when the dude directs action and intention   hes on ahis own level theres something about ti on my the edge of seat this movie fucking rules  excorcist  french connection has the car chase you know the dude knows what hes doing with action 

this movie was lacking in a lot of ways  had i not seen the orginal i would feel differently about it but like there was something lacking in just the psychological tension  i did not care about the characters at all  the characters are just a literal another vehicle  different vehicle than actual characters watching while crossing a bridge and shit 

the cars are main character  hats are secondary character  humans are tertiary tier and that said 70 movies rule 3 drips of nitroglycerine 
funny shag brought up sorcerer  cause the firs ttime i watched this which was not the first time i watched this that was years ago  but first time i watched this week it was like man this is weird a remake i havent seen the orginal  im on its edge im on its mind 

i looked into it i read a little about it the soundrack is updatd the fvoiceover is all new too the movie  when i watche dit while trippin like it cemented in my brain im watching lone wolf n cub  what im watchign is shogunassasssin and its its own fuckin thing and a man and his sun trying to fight every trap and hes got sound design on his side  hes got voiceover on his side  hes got the sound of voiceover on his side 

i gotta watch lone wolf n cub its not shogun assassin and when you ask me about lone wolf n cub i will show you shogun assissin because 

why

the

fuck

not

5 swords  sheds a tear 
yeah  i like  

what can i say  sylvester stallone is a great guy in this movie  beaug brandenburg hes a nice guy

kit pardue is a super nice guy and i wish him all the rest  bernenberg

sam shut up

it’s a movie about three nice guys being friends an dbeing forced to race against each other  it sucks and is terrible and the scene in chicago is truly a highlight 

great fucking garbage ass movie worth 1 distrstessed denim cowboy hat
agree with jordan   is eager 

this movie was dumb  uh like jordan this was the third steven segall movie i saw 

i unlocked the very first segall movie i ever saw as a kid  the 1 pg 13 segall movie with jarule called  half past dead  

so that was fun to unlock that in my brain 

otherwise  uh  yeah this movie man  at least the first 45 minutes  the vp thing was fun  after that the movie was like what are we doing here  and then shit started popping off and fuckin great 

only reason why i was actually engaged in this movie was to hear the phrase exit wounds uttered 

and it never  happened 

theres like 2 second left in th emove  segall walkin away isiah washington  how they gonna fit it in  didnt

i have to bring it down from the rating and give it 1 starchy heron teeshurts
uhhh okay 

iee  just  off the get go  i had no idea what   the fuck we were gonna get into with this movie 

the tought occurred to me  oh yeah i bet a john waters movie would be fun  hes sposed to be trashy and interesting 

i forgot what i was even signing this group for  i forgot that devine eats dogshit  and then i was like    oh yes  this is that 

and that was you know  after all the other insane shit 

shag s text  like i dont know if you guys had watched the movie before that point  i wa slike   oooh no what are we getting into 

the first half  its rough  its a bad movie its pooryly made  poorly acted  and some of the shit that was just going on it was givin me the heeby jeebys 

but then all of the sudden it was like goign trhough a wall  the movie kciked into overdrive for me and i twas like  this is some of the funniest shit ive ever seen in a while 

i couldnt  i remember going to the theatre seeing jackass 2  i would love to see this in theatres with a bunch of unsuspecting people just not knowing what the fuck was going to happen on screen 

after it was over i wanted to watch th ebonuses and i was purely in a awe after this movie  i gotta give it 4 ragign buttholes 
yeah  put me in the camp of shag and sam  this week has been fuckin crazy since i took on the new gig 

trying to watch this movie  like oh no i gotta squeeze this one in today i was sooo happy to be watching this movie 

also like    when johnson picked this movie i was like i have no idea what this movie is  ive never heard of it th eonly two movies where the title rings a bell  lapsis and medium raw 

um  so not knowing what iw as getting ingto with this      dude johnson  thank you  thank you for picking this movie 

i was like dude  this movie slept on 

yeah its got problems its clunky but damn  i stumbled on a lost gem  i was in it  it brought joy to my day to where my body was physically dude you gotta take anap and finish before the call tonight 

talkin bout it with you guys yeah this movie just made me happy and all the other movies i give this rating all i can say i felt full on like dumb  elation  watcion thinm i gotta gib it 5 of dem patriotic patriotic topless biker tortureres
bounces off reif 

shag if you want a one sentence review  don’t fuckin call me out  this aint happen 

no  i  i  i feel for a little bit of what reif was saying enve though i have more history with this movie 

i literally thoguht it was the funniest shit ive ever seen  mallrats sat as comedy movie pantheon in my head 

as i was watching it yesterday  something about it was a  little sour  but we talked a lot about that and what it really came down to the way brody and ts came off throughout 

i dont like them as the heros of this movie  or at least there wasnt    jeremy london is not convincing as a character that ts is supposed to be 

a way more competent and likeable actor would have been able to pull of that final dating showgame but all that said   

i gotta agree with sam and shag that this movie is fun  its fun its a lot of fun and the comedy works in a lot of places even if its not funny 

but really this movie is the stepping stone to jay and silent bob strike back 

that movie i feel very confident that it would be fuckin hilarious  mallrat had the same energy but not there 

history i wanted to look unkind on it but the conversation pulled the cat and gerbil out of my ass and i gotta give it 3 chocolate coverated stink palmbs
 jordan sings 

so maybe uh  ill put the thesis at the top of this one 

i think the conversation was better than the movie  but also it got me thinking about th emovie again and theres a lot about this movie that is really funny… but there is a lot wrong with it 

we discussed that 

dustin hoffman  warren batey  get them outta here 

something about the script  it was such a weird and wild watch  it was the frist time when i recognized like 

oh the script is good and the actors are just working for the matierla 

i just think this is a movie that was 5 to 10 years after its time 

um  which isnt necessarily a bad thing but it  uh you sorta see why a movie like this is a misfire in the 80s 

uh i understand the cult appeal around it now  and im not fully on board with it yet  but if you threw this on at a party i would be cacklin my ass off in certain parts 

rogers and clarke you guys aint 1 and don ein my eyes and i think you got another hit on yuh 2 rogers and clarke hit recerds 

hit recahds
um 

i fucking hated this 

nah dude zero cyclo genosiderz see evidence battlefield earth the year 3000

i don’t know what it is  i had fun  i was able to see connections between this and medium raw  the only thing that truly deserves a zero 

so yeah  it needed a friend  i konw i gave masked and anonymous a zero but that one i regret  so my score now this season i got to run the gamet accidentally 

daniel  he hit the cyclo  whoa hake  im proud of you

same  fuckin contrived  fake bullshit right there

hake  naw dude  i hated this movie 

sam  no man it didnt deserved a zero dude  dude it deserved a 1  just sometimes not zero  not zero there 

daniel  he hit the cylce  it was beautiful 

hake 

alright  i changed my mind  0 0 cyclo 
so yeah like johnson i started this movie and got really critical  not for what johnson was critical of but more like forresst witacker not knowing what the fuck to do with the camera

then i settled in and once that secene between wesley snipes and angela basset like here we go i dunno shit like really solidified for me like i felt like the charm of the movie reeealy really came alive 

started taking the dynamics of all the relationships more seriously  the movie stopped waiting to exhale  lol 

ok so i gotta say  i will give it 3  enduring friendships    

sidechat about forrest whitaker

shag  i dunno im makin stuff up 

um

i so i mostly agree with everything been said before 

i went back to the question i posed earlier about the theme  whats it about in summation and my review 

you just gotta give yourself a little self love unless you can break the cycle of self destruction  

3 flaming faces 


um

i so i mostly agree with everything been said before 

i went back to the question i posed earlier about the theme  whats it about in summation and my review 
actual hake  not the previous one   i will say my body and spirit were prepared for this movie  a part of me was always curious of mamma mia and i was fully ready to acept the dumb spirit of this movie  this movie is candy  but what i will say  this movie melted my stone cold cynical heart  but abba is infectious and the cast is incredible  but most of the cast and abba don t mix  i was disappointed in the set pieces as a movie musical it just didn t pop  i was bored and my brain was wanting to have fun but i wanted to zip through a musical number to get to fun but i m glad i saw it  i m glad i got to be a part of the cultural zeitgeist of mamma mia  i ll see the segual  gotta see what cher does  i m with my boy jordan  2 tbds 

 bounces off that 

earlier in the day i was talking to sam about foreign films that i have seen  they all have this air or prestige about it  you are getting like… something that feels important 

 air quotes  artistic

so it was really fun to sort of watch a movie that really felt  almost designed in a way that a hollywood studio would be but for russian audiences 

caveat  it comes with maybe propoganda or anything that in there 

but i was really suprised by the idea of the movie was so much fun  anything with smugglers  i thought the really first have was sort of like just had like a wilder energy 

the slipping on the melon joke as the codeword i thought was brilliant 

yeah so it sort of just like became like almost like a sketch after sketch yeah we like just go through adventures with diamond arm but gonna fail 

for most part it was enjoyable  really really fun look at a think like one country s side of movie making that other than andre tarkofsky  i know nothing about russian cinema  i really enjoyed this movie i give it 3 robes with fuck i forgot the buttons 

shaggy   clams 

kevin   pearls 
soo ya know having ventured into a lot of batmans stuff as of recent or superhero stuff generally  um  this was a really nice reminder of what s great about batman and dc animztion and some superhero stories i really love  that they go for the emotional throat of this  bruce s backstory is awesome  its effective  it makes the twist work  for a kids movie its pretty dark and adult in some suprising ways  sitting down for 76 minutes and i felt like i was sold an appitizer and got a whole meal so 4 batarangs 


 hake shows pubes 

i gotta normas small rage going on right now 

so yeah  i was excited when elysia picked this movie  someone recommend when i was in denver movie night club and older woman who was very much into musicals was like  you gotta see this movie 

came up on my list  lets do it  wanna see this 

we sat down last night  we were starting a bit late  shit we got 2 hours 15 minutes 

movie moves  gots that 60s spirit i love  the way the larger comedic set pieces and large club restaurant eruptions  waiter comes back in the club right before the improvised dance 

on the scene where the one dance and 4 guys  two of the faceing front and back with the masks holy shit that sequence was phenomenal 

last half hour was last half hour  nuff said  its a bummer 

so  4 normas small rages 
duuuude yeah 

this  this isa movie that ive known about for a while as i was a kid  always wanna see since its been recommended to me a lot so i was pretty just like if not excited i wa slike alright lets check this movie off  off the list 

i had a really conflicting interesting time with it  this conversaction really puts this movie in a higher esteem thatn i had with i was watching it 

just because tonally it threw me all over th eplace  the punching down was a problem  even for the time period 

um  from just the like  i mean  at the forefront of everything which we talked about which is ableist and some of the asian american family  straight up i dont know where they necessarily are punching down  i feel like they are punching down on rural america without the heart  but the actors lit that up and that s amazing  i love brittany murphy  lots of characters that really work 

dark tonal shifts with people who blown up in trailer like whoa she survived  felt really herky jerky with this 

murder mystery didntw ork even though beauty pageot worked on skits together 

structurally i was just bored confused it took me out of th emovie a lot and lots of humur i really missed i gotta go with initial i do tend to rate these things on initial phases of what i watched this movies from  she might have only gotten 1 beer cans saudeed to her hands but i gotta give it 2 beer can hands 
 wakes up from nap 

did you try to use the alarm system  what did your father teach you 

 universal lols 

my father taught me that this movie is pretty tight pretty weird and i had fun with it i liked the cinematography and last shot blew me away and i was like jesus christ did i get tricked into watching a 1920s silent movie  3 cig 
im at the midwaypoint of the reviews and so far i think that the uh consenus  maybe not everyone agrees with me  and im with this consensus 

there seems to be some good bones to this movie   jordan  but bad blood 

good bones  but bad blood 

the blood s a wash for me  had no idea goin into it  i was hoping snoop dogg was going to be a pimp in this movie   shag  or in it 

i like it  sucked in the beginning  middle third oh we gotta interesting movie on our hands  final third i checked out even tho shit happened 

2 spooky maggot rain houses
lets move past zombie  sharing some of your sentiments  ryan and sam  i was checked out the third act of this movie which i was kinda excited for  this movie was violent nothing crazy gorey 

half way point and zombies battle shark  this is gonna get crazy  then it was in slow motion the third act 

up until the nurse got killed and the reusing footage of molotov cocktail i was pretty disappointed in int  soundrack isa  5 but yea this movie overall 2 tits out scuba divers 
like sam i remember this movie being on comedy central  but i did not see as much of the movie as he did 

only thing i remember was tounge down the throat punchin out the heart  so yeah  i was pumped to finally get to watch this movie  see some tales of the crypt 

the crypt keeper lived up to all of my expectations of what i wanted to see  i wish it had less wet blanket human being dennis miller 

2 skin expresses down to tuna tow  did i get that right 
so like one of my favorite sayings in all movies is hunt for the wilderpeeple where sam niel does almost nothing the entire movie but he s really funny 

then you watch possession where he is a younger man and he s like really fun 

this movies crazy um  4 trashcan feathers 
this movie lulled me in a way that like  theres a certain like  theres a charm to it  when i started it  theres  theres almost like a tv movie feel to it 

just how it starts  how he s getting taking care of  the sheen on the cinemtography and wholesome nature of the town   there s a lot of this movie that feels so wholesome 

your aunt  never seen a movie before  you want to entertain her  so you are like  yeah lets watch misery  

so theres no cursing or violence in the first 50 minutes  but then at the end you have to find out what happens no matter what  um  yeah  idunno i love this movie 

4 bitchly calf cow corns 

cow feet 

i misquoted it  she said pig feed and cow corn in that speech 
meet my delights to twist your tounges 

i was kinda like i dunno lukewarm about watching this movie 

i was not excited about john carpenters made for tv movie 

i just watched one 

o fuck that’s right tales for the crypt 

hbo movie  its not tv its hbo  network tv especially carpenter knowing its in the 70sbefore he got famous i was worried going in 

i twist had a lot of fun watchin this movie  more fun then i ever thought i would

constraints interesting totally break through even the music was missing still channeld it with his camera i loved and creeped out for all of it 

laura hutton was fantastic  yeah just had a blast with this movie 

4 almost grabbed shards of glass 

when shag picked this movi ewas pretty excied for it and i watched it last night in kinda a like half catatonic state i gotta get this movie in im excited i didn’t know what was going on i felt like i couldn’t keep up with i t in the way i wanted to but i was 

i dunno  this like i will stand by what i said earlier in this coversation like thank the movie club gods for this movie  i like shag have seen a shitton of depalmas movies  there s something about him where it kinda doesnt matter what the subject matter or theme of the movie is  i have watched ever depalma movie i have seen even his shittiest movies i have been somewhat enteratined by 

his filmmaking is on some crazy mastermind wavelength like in a hollywood way i just wanna see what his next fram is gonna look like even if it doesnt pay off in the end and this one exists on a weird different plane and level instead of his hitchcock ripoff films even with the hitchcock ripoff like the plunger to the face was great

all the movie is super great and super problematic and it bothers me but it doesnt i had a blast of a time 5 beef 
oooooh 

gonna start this off rel quik by sayin shag   fuck you tryin to do  fault in ofself and discussion other night  yer just wrong  citizen kane great movie 

this movie… not a great movie 

but i love it  after i went down the orsen wellse pipeline  it has lots of love and lore for ow fans  first time is aw i was tained but fused from esteem it had 

i feel like a lot of the steam comes from how unique it sits in the greater i think mostly in the noir category 

it isnt a noir movie but it adheres to the staples we see in the genre  this movie continues to sit in my head 

like a lot of times 

in the last 2 years i havent seen the movie    grisbees sweaty face sits there like  how boutcha murder mee for  5 000 

i wanted to put his sweaty face in your heads  glad you liked it 

i give it from the hall of meers standport grisby showin up in the 3 mirrors of excitable sweaty grisbeez 
gogogogogogogo 

love cronenburg and was excited for this pick  don’t like  im indifferent about burroughs and beatnik 

specially knowing grody and gross interesting in the 90s but the sheen of that interestingness has worn off as we move further way from it

i did like a lot of this movie and what croneburg was tryin to do  

had hard time following it and had no idea what peter weller was ssaying

the bugs were cool

i liked the spyness of interzone and agent things 

what it all mean  uh yeah i dunno what going on  cept william tell act killing his lover twice 

maybe he is saying burroughs needs to dig deep at clearly the wound which is him william telling his wife in the first place

if someone threw this movie on and i would sit down adn watchit again cause really interesting but the first time slipp through my fingers so 3 sips of mugwump jhism 

lets do this

i had seen this movie  i saw it in colleg and pretty sure sam mentioned it a bunch  member this movie  go  then he quoted the n word line 

i was like yeah watched this movie  go  so i watched it in college and it stuck with me 

at least when sam picked it i wa slike  oh yeah okay i remember the chopped up format with multiple stories kinda revolving around 1 thing 

was disappointed in the way it didnt actually revolve around 1 thing 

after sara coranna gets hit with the car  im like here we go the titular movie 

then its like naw im gonna do this other thing over here  cliffhanger fun over 

i had a lot of fun watching the movie and it had really great energy going for it  as dumb as las vegas story is  theres lotsa fun shit inner 

frustrating way movie tease you up with multiperspectivea round 1 event setup  it doesnt do that which is rellyfrustating to me 

feels like a shrug when it coulda been a grub

all these parties connecting on one thing 

thats the big knock i gotta give so 3 awefuck i forgot the rating 

herb

granola

based herb drugs 

i had a lot of fun watching this movie 

i watched it in two parts  first part yesterday  i was really enjoying it  love setup and everyhing where it was going 

character dynamics  dynamic of group  computer nerds pulling miliatry guy and use him to be ilike   no basic setup of movie 

whole back half has sombre tone that is most interesting payoff you are here for awesome action revenge and im just still digesting that 

i finnish this movie on high net but conversation send me to reality and like i dunno kinda cooled me on the moovie so yeah i like finishing it i was a 4 im after conversation im a 3 chubby salamis 
you ready 

yes yes i am 

my review is jordans last line of his review 

its everybody jee golly theyre swell but they heckin cuss  but i did like it a little more than jordan did 

yeah  i agree with a lot of jordans sentiments  i really enjoyed the conversation more than i did the movie 

but i liked the time capsule of the movie  its a type of movie that i just dont voluntarily watch anymore

this whole    i dunno  james l brooks feels weird to call a totally vanilla movie a  vibe  man  but it is  in its own weird and straightforward way  um yeah  dunno  3 orangejuice concentrated screwdrivers 
the beets of the doug episode  you got it perfect my dude  really nice job my friend  we are so great together 

killer tofu  eieie  i cant tell you how much it’s the episode where he thinks hes a rockstar getting interviewed by the dream sequence in the girl school and its like    how you come up with those songs and looks at a plunger and is like   the plunger 

ill go next 

i like this movie  had a lot of fun stuff  and a lot of things that ill remember forever  and yeah it was mostly fine 

i think the tried to do too many styles at once maybe  wished it woulda committed in some different darker ways than the movie tried to do so 3 shopping cart uncles 
this was not my first time watching this movie  i had seen it before  and yeah 

i was very excited to rewatch this  and i will say i was also very exhausted watching it last night  i feel like i was being assaulted by the movie 

very much into the first half but by the time the restaurant came around i was like  this hurts to watch 

wasnt that pleasant viewing this time around  but i love this movie  as a remnant of it s time and what it s doing its so much fun and funny 

like i said  the weird cold utilitarianness of it is offputting as it is and very funny to me and highly orchestrated 

by the time it gets to the nightclub it s descended into pure chaos  

first time watching i was high as fuck  i felt like i was watching someone make samsara into a highly stylized play and still feel that way 

5 crown brands as entry passes into recursive clubs 

jordan  well done 
first time watch for me  but i definitely leaned on the side of enjoying the ride despite all the like… flaws i was sort of seeing with the movie  you know  using black america as texture even if it worked in some instances a lot of it was hmm this didnt age well 

yeah i was kinda just like    along for the ride  then when shit got really wild in th ebackhalf i was like man  he is like i thought the direction was amazing 

kinda walked an interesting tightrope  i just really enjoyed it so i agree with whateverbody has said as far as the lauding it and criticize it but yeah i enjoyed the watch so 4 virginia is for lubbers t shirts 
ill go next 

i watched the movie juwanaa mann whenever it came out on dvd  im pretty sure i laughed 

i watched it last night and i wa slike  ya now  this is pretty bad  but not as bad as other movies  i thought it moved along at a decent clip even if i was appalled by the comidee and finding it not funny 

2 flawless titty cups  2 flawless cgi titty cups

i agree with everything  you guys have said about mike meyers in general and kinda this movie too 

at times i felt like  disappointed realizing mike meyers is a one trick pony and realizing his schtick is fully there and the outlier with perfect encapsulation of him 

i found it fascinating  i really enjoyed watching this movie  for all of the bad and all of the good 

cameos  great 

michael richards is great and mike meyers does his anniversary thing and then michael richards is like we just doing this  and then mike meyers devolves into his bit but man this movie gives no fuck whatsoever as for carrying the viewer like  yeah fuck you here s a comedic bit 

i dunno it was a frankenstein of different movie ideas 

i did like the conceit of an axe murderer romantic comedy  i found mike myers a charming boy and 2 woman central to the plot and 2 more wooooooooo oooo man   4 units in total
steaming pile of divits
steaming polo divits

divots

 spelling discussion ensues 

so yeah this was always a movie as i was growing up watching movies  like eh… this wasn’t for me  this isnt a movie for me…  but i cant hate it 

i mean  you can hate it  there s a lot ot pick apart  like we did this evening  but its pretty damn charming  julie roberts is fantastic i see how she got so fuckin famous 

richard gere was kinda a wet blanket in this movie  but yeah gary marshall knows how to make a charming picture 

3 steaming polo divots 

jordan posed a question   is this movie trying to be a 4 quadrant movie  

i don’t know  i like what this movie did and we awere talking about this movie in the night about 4 marilyne monroe movies but those seem to fit more into th emold that jordan is trying to look at like it fits inside a box but it refuses to beinside the box 

im not trying to rebut jordans critique of the movie but it falls inside why i find this movie fascinating and works for amovie coming from that time and  also we didnt talk about one scene that i flat out found fucking hilarous 

general passes out inject drugs uhhhhh thud on the ground 

general thuds on the ground 

so fuckin funny

and they delay it a beat  dude you fall on the ground  oo the general 

yeah i love this movie i had a blast like uh i found i dunno holly wood doing italian neo realism was really interesting like  hey heres the thing we are doing for world wide cinema like i dunno if they tryin to pull something like two fascinating moments in astrangth time like hackted dont fuppul off fully 4 humy handsy sonegoes mouth 
i believe in johnson… cause masked and anonymous is cropping up a couple times tonight  that was another call that johnson missed  and that one hurt 

he came through with a review the next week  i dunno 

ryan just thank you for picking this movie  im so fuckin glad i got to see it  its bad in all the right ways  yet simultaneously fascinating and kinda great  i dunno  im a whole mixed bag 

i gonna copout on a 3  the ending of this movie is not earned and at the end of it i feel for james gandalfini and susy sareenee 

the filmaking is solid enough tuturrro is goin for bloke and goin so fun and dirty and lewd and weird and  again  indy movies in the early 2000s tryin to create new weird new wave movies of 60s and 70s swings always there 

there was a lot of competency in the movie 

yeah so fuckin glad i saw this 4 cucumbers in a gardners ass 

when johnson told me he was picking this movie a few weeks ago i was pretty excited because i remember being 13 or 14 reading the review in rolling stone magazine being like  oooo this sounds like there s gonna be nudity in it  i should check it out  

ive alwasy known about it and known it was supposed to be a funy kinky movie    was pretty let down by it  we touched on stuff like 

not displaying consent in the beginning  first spanking scene happened and aleysia screamed at the television and i kept waiting for the movie to i guess like    straighten itself out from that weird dynamic that was presented 

it always came across as creepy and inappropriate  until the movie was like oh its a rom com and they gonna get together and whatever 

ive read a bunch of reviews  the response to it left me very confused 

either way  movie left me feeling weird  2 hairbrush bathroom spanks 
ummm so dis was a movie i have known about forever 

since i was a kid ive known about the rocketeer 

onlything i remember is timothy dalton burning up in a horrifying accident  so i was pumpt to get to fulfill a childhood goal of finally seeing this movie 

i was like  first half i was like  hm dont this is fine 

then the second half was having a ton of fun  him flying around the restaurant was fun and i was like nothing but delighted when a german army showed up outta nowhere 

german vs mafia vs fbi sandbox give me everything  yeah i dunno i had a ton of fun watchin this movie 

billy campbell what a fuckin wet blanket 3 slices of pepsin gum 
ill go 

alicia had see this movie and she was all excited for it and she was all  get ready for this movie  like david hyde pierce  love it  

i had heard wispers of this movie  the weekend before i watched this i was like  is this that cannibal moovie 

for the first hour i was on board  diggin it  like obviously now they gonna torture this guy gonna be fun  and yeah  throughout the movie its been a minute since i kinda actively gotten mad at a movie  i watched and just been uh turn after turn what are you doing why are you doing this  and pretty much when whatever guy from lethal weapon finds out oh nope my throat didnt get slit like how much we have left like thank you for this pick thank you for this atrociousness thats been delivered  we been watching too many decent ass movies 

feels good to give 1 cheeky ass movie box  lfg dude  one is all you need 
anti gravity love song 
aliens are real or something 
incubus 

im already on spotify 

is stellar about aliens 

certain shade of green 

envious of this movie 

its green but im not super positive about it  tame green  green of this season 

never knew of this movie  never seen anything about it  heard anything about it until alysia was like this is a movie from my childhood you should check it out 

not a billy cristil fan  honestly  1 scene in princess bride  this movie does not make me a billy kristal fan but it does make me a danny devito fan 

i really liked his performance in this movie  its this movie is truly a mixed bag  i found it really interesting to watch 
the comedy really worked for me i found myself cracking up quite a bit 

his childlike performance is    i was fascinated by it  i cant say i necessarily defend it maybe it was exploiteative i dunno am i laughing at him  are the pathos real  its leaning into dark comedy but the movie doesnt want to put its full foot in its odd enough that like alright ill go along with this  3 copies of mr pinksies 100 girls id like to pork 
so 

my dad  taped this movie offa hbo onto vhs and like  i remember just growing up like you gotta watch vh1 

i m 8 or nine  hes like no  you cant watch it  it s r  you can t hear that language yet 

i was 10 or 11 and he let me watch midnight run  and    yeah  something about it stuck with me  it s just a great  the deniro doing comedy at this point is perfect  i knew of deniro as a tough  so watching him be so like  broadly comedic as a kid still works to this day 

i had a moment with a bit of a conflict  i was like    wow this movie is like a solid dad movie  the fistophobia joke that s always been stuck in my head because my dad loved that joke 

there s others  i wish i knew what they were 

then i was like  is deniro capable of being a comedic actor  is he funnier in this or meet the parents 

what is this 

what is his performance like sort of trading in on 

cause like the moment with his daughter or wife really caught me off guard because he balances the ridiulousness and keeps it balanced and believable and charles grodin like  whatever you re doing keep it up man 

grodin was the reason to watch this movie  but unsure about deniro mainly as a comedic person 

but looved  yeah  i have a soft spot  i am entertained by agreeing with everyone that it hits that right sweet spot of an 80s action comedy so 4 non counterfiet noncounterfiet 20s 
yeah  i just was so happy watching this movie last night 

kid in a candy store that was exploding with candy and flames 

god  i just kept watching the movie going like   man they don t make em like they used to  then oh  this is why they don t make em like they used to 

they didnt use safety concerns or computer effects 

last shebang out on fuckin top 

no doubt its 5 day saving little piss pots 

it was really funny going through the logic of this movie and none of it makes sense 

its all kinda bad and i just dont care  it was one of thos wow i felt 10 years old watching a movie again in so long 

i said my peace  5 
ummm 
this was a movie had always been curious about since i was a kid  

then as i got older and maybe just  influenced by  i dunno that i read any critical pieces on toys  just that its oh… this movie isnt the like  shiny package that you think it was as a kid 

neither was it a weird adult movie that  the weird adult movie that you think it s gonna be 

i had preconcieved notions going into it  it neither met those and i dunno  i enjoyed watching this movie 

i uh  it was weird  it was disappointing in a lot of ways which we talked about 

i was always curious visually about what was going on screen  i feel like  yeah i dunno as a k  having the perspective of being a kid who wanted to see the movie and didnt get to see it til he was 32  33 and knows what the movie is trying to do somehow made it better 

i feel like thats a slim group for what the target audience of what this movie tryin to hits 

i dunno i kinda liked it 

3 peas and carrots in a problematic puke pile 

it was  this movie definitely kept me intrigued throughout all of it  i know very little about what happened with china since mao s revolution i was like oh… modern china up to mao s revolution 

i was disappointed in the movie that it didn’t spoon feed me cultural events in china  you got the gist of it but it was all from the perspective of the emperor but he was so secluded from everything that even you the audience like you are watching it from this isolated persons perspective which was an interesting choice 

which did keep you   it was a good choice to keep you with that character through constantly changing things 

i got a little frustrated with some of the second half because of the weird spy character and i was on board with it all the way through 

i felt caught off guard bythe final scene when he meets the child guard and finds the cricket thing  it was a capping moment to the fairytaleness that just sort of sealed it for me like oh yeah i really really enjoyed it gotta gvie it 4 turds in a bowl 
umm  yeah  so rewatching
this movie was… i mean i 
had a blast  i hadn t watched
it in a few years  it was one of
those when i made the choice
i was like… yeah  this would
be my sort of like… i m
gonna pull this one out from
the vault to show 

and i had a blast  there s
a lot of nostalgia tied up
around it and i just did 
kinda found it funny  i think
in all the improve comedy
podcasts i listened to recently
so comedians riffing on that
in a way that s like a lot of
rick moranais and dave thomas
its just like hilarious  not som  
 thing like my 5 yr old brain would have 
      picked up on  they

        
          the soundtrack brought me 
           back i dunno i gotta give this 
             5 2 minute pisses on 
                a loony bin 

                          none of the sci fi works                        its different 

                                                                                       that s what makes it stick with me                                                         more than the banter 

then the banter is 5  no rugrets  you all can take off 

i hope everyone gives their money a 5 
ummm
yeah

so hadnt seen this movie 

was excited to see in because of the auh  remembering about it highschool and then it started 

and i went ooo nooo 

between the introductory title card scene in the first fight  i was like 

oh man  i was no expecting this 

and then the movie started shoving along and i uh started getting into it 

at least like 

i dunno  i was just down with it 

i was like  it s stupid  its interesting enough from its time period  it had a very watchable cast 

i dunno  as i was watching it i was feeling like  yeah my kneejerk reaction was like a little unfair 

this movie does have something going on 

there was some cool action sequences  there was also soem really bad action sequesnces 

three taye diggs faces on a marble floor 


alright so  yeah  sam introduced me to this movie wen that was 1920 years old  hey watch onna my favorite movies  watched it  loved it 

was really taken away with it  and then hadnt i don’t know i don’t think i had rewattched it until last year and that was i might ahave been the frist time i rewatched it 

i got sick with noravirus i was out for 24 hours puking and shitting my pants and um  ive got nothin to do but watch movies all day today and i was like im gonna watch the natural

was watching and it it was just the movie was just the pace i wanted to be at 

it was slow it was magical i can just vibe with this movie and im sick as a dog and want nothing more to be just at the top of my game 

then when robert deniro redford is in a battle with his stomach  and its gonna cost him his life to play his game   me with my stomach vomitting and shitting every where i just went  this movie is like me right now 

this is what its like to be a baseball player and i just fully connected with this movie 

this is a movie metaphor about not shitting your pants  you dont have control of your bowels in this movie  if you gotta fart its like a liquid stream of diahreaa commin out yer ass 

i give it 4 pieces of that poisoines thing  poisonous little morsel tartlet  4 pieces of poisones morsel tarlet 

this is one im pretty sure my parents showed me when i was a younger age 

ive always know it as some sort of  fresh  viewing 

watching it  i gotta admit like  its… its very open presence as a musical  while i appreciate it hits you in the face with it  and its like take you in the face this is what you are getting   

im like jordan  im not a musical person 

i found it really funny like with some songs and i liked the way it used musical constraints and filmed itself as a stageplay 

motorcycle flies outta the sky and lands  that shit cracked me up  presenting itself as this larger than life sorta thing 

i was also not   i just wasnt keen on the songs 

there was something about them that didnt click with me  even if i    i liked how they were maybe placed or worked within the story 

they got everything across but when they were happening i was slightly disengaged 

even something like suddenly seymour  i feel like this should be working for me objectively like    its there    emotionally i feel like i want what its supposed to be doing but its not delivering for me 

maybe its a matter of taste or not a good song or whatever  when ryan said these guys did a disney score and maybe it felt like a band making their first album figuring something outa long the way  didnt full click but i really relaly like a lot of this stuff even if ti didnt fully click 

so i lean 3 glitterly shiba tulip duliply things 
um

 unintelligble 

this was another piggy back offa ryan and johnson  this was a movie where my dad was like  you gotta watch uncle buck 

i knew i seen it in some kinda pieced together fashion on the cable channels all the time  but it was never one where i sat down and truly watching 

we never read it  so i never saw the script 

there was enough of it that couldnt escape the cable sensors where my kid brain could remember what it was but i never connected with it in the way that you had those movies with nostalgia lense 

so watching it    last night    was sort of like    i knew it was gonna happen in the end  but i could not really even    could not even remember what the hell happend for the first 9 10ths of the movie 

reinforced what i love about john candy  john hughs movie was planes trains and automobiles which i wanna rectify 

i had a great time with the movie even though it had warts 

mikuly kulkin what a precious treasure  pre home alone as kevin mcallister but no fuckin movie yet 

yeah    4 gnat circumcising hatchets 
uuuuuuh yeah  awah what can i say that hasn’t been said 

this was the comedy central movie for me 

i know i said earlier   i don’t think that i got it  and i kept rewatching it  and i think it was one of those first movies where i finally understood what a cult movie was 

the sort of movie where you start quoting it amongst friends and its like  ah yeah  they get it too 

rewatching i was like yeah 

so much seeped into be just browsed forums on reddit where you quote office space and get upvoted immediately 

forgetting so many quotes from this movie cause hadnt watched in a while 

so loved getting to remember it its a classic its a 4 bob movie for me 

ps  i am always disappointed every time i see the box office art and its milton with a stapler behind a man with post it notes all over his head and body and peter never really did this 

okay  so its my turn 

i enjoyed a lot of this movie 

to kinda take pieces from other peoples reviews  johnson looking at it from a kid angle 

there was one point where i thought this movie was taking too long 

had i watched it as a kid i think it wouldnt have held my interest 

it just took too much time to get going 

and as a kid that would have either bored me or watching the main character suffer a little too much at the hands of the bullies 

can we just get to the jackie chan and karate kid 

once it started going i wa slike this is fun and the crazy shit like the cobra woman 

a lot of the humor worked  like him trying to mind trick his mom was really funny

i also felt conflicted during this movie  while the aging down to twelve year olds made the drama better  theres something about the action where my adult brain just couldnt conform with it in a way 

jackie chan shouldnt be beating up these kids  nor should these kids be going so hard on each other

mostly i tuned that side of my brain out and i was like yeah  beat the fuck out of each other 

the scene where jackie chan gives jaden a shirt that looks like bruce lee wore in a movie  my head thought jackie chan was presenting him a piece of bruce lees actual garments 

what the fuck is happening in this movie 

yeah  it broke my brain for a little bit 

pulling out i realized how i was wrong  but i thought that was funny

anywayas 3 jackets up with attitude 

ill go 

release the cut with channing tatum s red rocket  1 flying spaceboot 
ill go next 

yeah i… i guess i had more fun with the conversation than i did for most of the movie  i did have a lot of fun for most of the movie  in no way did i think it was all that great 

it s an interesting way to do it  but yeah  i kinda kept trying to uh  what is a terrible hollywood movie from this time  if you showed this to someone from another culture or some other thing  i came up a little blank  it s silly  fun mostly ridiculous  still only worthy of two removed sunglasses 
i watched this movie this morning with many cups of coffee and… i had a real good time with it 

it was having seen night is short walkon girl was   i uh  i very much enjoyed the streamlined narrative of it  but then kinda allowed the visuals to break off and bea  little more wild 

even though we did piece of a little of it tognith  it was relatively easy viewing  i was moved by the   freindship between inu oh and tomari  i was moved by the eventual turn of the govt being like  nah cant do their art we need our 1 streamlined narrative 

emotionally i think it hit all the good beats and really enjoyed it so four cursted elongated armz 

yeah 

i would imagine the holllywood pitch meeting went something like 

 so in naked lunch  we got an exterminator killin bugs as a metaphor for herione addiction and closeted homosexuailty  so instead what if instead we did video game characters that are plumbers killing dinosaurs that are a metaphor for rampant domestic abuse and closeted homosexuality  

i kept watching super mario bros  and thinking that this was naked lunch but with dinosaurs 

2 screamin martini worms 
i ll go next please 

um  i agree with sam about the voice acting and some of the animation being a distraction and really taking me out of the movie 

for the first third i just never felt centered in it 

with just bringing me into the world  i had to like    force myself to like    almost like notice what was going on  

but um  as it chugged along i watched this with alecia last night    i should say 

alecia grew up with this movie and had childhood memories associated with it 

it got to the end and i was like  goddamnit  i wish this was 20 or 30 minutes longer  i never got to see cool stuff that were emotional beats for me  i was like yeah i guess we are here now  but i was like    i cant hate on the message of this movie because it is on the end of the day i think trying to teach about love and empathy with the curing of rex and bringing him out of the brain drain  everyone should do that 

yeah   love and empathy will make you turn not into a lizard brain 

from a parents perspective is like all i get is 63 minutes and have my kid zoom in and be entertained by dinosaurs  i guess i dont have to be entertained as a parent  but you could entertain me as well 

i landed on two circuses with the notion of spiiieeeece 
um 

this is my second viewing  i haven t seen it since the end of college and that viewing was like i said  very like…  confused and underwhelmed   just whelmed 

it was almost like a first viewing 

i know its like a murder plot  i thought they robbed the bar  i had that going into my head  i remember francis fighting for my life in my head  

i know its not the movie i remember but i had the same feelings  complete misunderstandings  i  gotta be honest  i was really proud of myself 

i felt really smart watching this movie and picking up on shit  this second time around i was like  oh thats why i didnt get this 

i think its yeah really interesting to see where the cohen brothers started and how much this movie is and isnt like the rest of their stuff 

lot of great scenes in this movie that does somthese movies equal to the parts of the movie 4 curtains 
i had a very kneejerk reaction to watching this movie last night 

i had a great time watching it 

i really do stand by the thought   were this a novel  it just had realy good bones i would love to read someones 400 pages novelization before it became a movie because i thought it brought up interesting ethical questions for the time and classism questions 

and then the movie was basically like  nah  its just a murder mystery with 50s noire sci fi stuff because you like that style of filmmaking 

either way i had such a blast watching this but then i woke up in the morning and i was like  everything i watched last night was bullshit and i questioned everything 

this conversation solidified so i gotta give it 5 chickenshitunmichaelphelps like brothers wtf 

one other pop cultural reference i had going into this movie  i don’t know if you guys heard cass mcomb songs  there s this song where he s trying to woo some 15 year old white trash girl 

the song is called  rancid girl  and he s calling her a rancid girl throughout the entire song  so if it was a clint eastwood film    then it would be a fun piece of pop late 70s trash 

clint eastwood is a nogood barenuckleboxer wooin women with his orangutan friend 

i was like wow i gave gattaca 5 stars  so i was like how the fuck am i going to defend this movie 

but then the movie literally tanked in the second half  and then it was like no clint is a better guy than this clint eastwood guy  and then i was like fuck this movie s got heart 

yeah 

im just glad i dont have to like  it didn t knock gattaca off the post  so gattaca still has 5 whatever i gave it out of and this one has 3 pissen shittin fartins and ass lickens
