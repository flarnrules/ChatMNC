i feel like i have to clairify something  so  i didn t necesarily say this was my favorite representation of batman  but this is the most acurate portrayal of the batman i read about and batman lore  i think this is the only feature film of batman where he doesn t murder anyone  which to me is a very intergral basic tenent of batman  this is the only batman film about trama and really gets into the pathos and reasoning that compels him to do what he does  even the nolan films doesn t get into the tortured things that compel him to stop if he wants to stop  ultimately he finds happiness and in this he can t  there s no happy ending for him  this gets to the tragic core in 76 minutes that nolan couldn t  there is something isolated and pure about this one  it has a special place in my heart  4 batarangs 


number 1 i want to thank elysia  number 2 i want to thank you for inviting me 

it was a delight  in the good ways it reminded me of all that jazz and caberet  i like musicals for the most part with exceptions like the sound of music  sorry julie andrews fans 

my quick review i dont have much to say that hasnt been said  first hour is 4 stars  second hour is 2 stars  so im gonna give it 3 stars  3 of norma s small rages  norma s small rages are a big part of why the first part is a 4 star 
i said this earlier  but i feel like talking to everybody i wish i had someone in the room while i watched this 

on the one hand you have this stacked cast of amazing incredible performers  on the other hand you have this just  hateful  mean spirited thing to me  it had early 2000s family guy vibes  which was a tough hang for me  i zoned out a little bit  i got mad a little bit   

i was not into it  and then hearing you guys talking about it i felt like i was watching a totally different movie 

i think i m just 20 years late to the game  that said  im gonna have to go with 2 seared beercanhands 
the movie reminded me of 2 things that arent movies  wait  wait  i am disappointed that i couldn’t bring up the talking point what is the weirdest thing you’ve ever heard while shitting in a public restroom  

reminded me of something projected on the wall in an art museum 

something non linear  no plot or narrative to it  just visually interesting  if you sit on the bench and are patient it will pay off 

and old 1800s and 1900s parlour stories where the characters are sitting around and telling stories and it shifts based on what the people say like the turn of the screw 

first 30 minutes into it

second 30 minutes kinda

last 30 minutes fell off the cliff 

overall very glad that i know this exists  glad i watched it  would watch again  so ill probably go with 4 cigarrettes 
 cross talk 

wait a second  i okay  there was something magical about this movie that made 2001 seem like it was 50 years ago  and i appreciated that 

however  it was kinda a bummer that i checked the time  the first time anything happened was 1 hour and 1 minutes into the movie and that was a bit of a drag 

snoop was well cast in the flashbacks  happy to see pam greer pop up  the final 20 minutes were a fun ride 

the movie reached for some sort of social commentary and it just wasnt able to quite grasp it unfortunately 

im gonna have to go with 2 spooky maggot rain houses as well 
well  i felt like this movie was 30 minutes longer than i had patience for  there was a good 20 minute chunk in the 3rd act where i completely checked out  the molotov cocktails part 

um  it grabbed my attention again in the closing moments with the surprise twist ending about new york  i dont think it was a twist ending or that much of a surprise if you relaly think about it but th emovie numbed my mind so much that i had completely forgot 

have to give credit for making my jaw drop at the end 

overall movie i want to give 1 star to  but scenes like  zombie vs shark  and  eye penetration  and certain other key moments of the movie that will be in my head forever  i want to give those parts 5 stars  overall i have to this 3 tits out scooba divers 
i recognize that i was exceptionally quiet during tonights call  because i had nothing to say about this movie  there was nothing to muse on and reflect on  i fell asleep during it and i had to rewind and rewatch it again  and i still forgot everything that happeend  i found nothing redeeming about it and i hate dennis miller a lot and i dont understand why he has a career and what the

sam  zeros are allowable

ryan  zero feels drastic  cause you know there was a cool puppet  there was some titties 

1 express skin express to tuna town for me 

its good to know that zero is an option in the future 
we were put in a unique situation where we had to watch this movie 2 times in 1 month  i would say that a month is long enough to digest 

yeah ill go ill go 

the first time i saw this  was maybe partially soley by jackasses sitting near us 

my main takeaway the first time i was really angry  i agree with johnson  i was mad at the characters and wanted them to shut the fuck up because they were screaming for 2 hours 

i wanted to get away from it because of the din and the noise assult 

now i realize  im supposed to feel that way  its supposed to make me sweat and tug on my collar and it was very successful on that goal 

this movie does for me for marriage wat psyco does for showers and jaws does to the beach 

i feel like it gestated in my head pretty well for the past 6 weeks  it was kind of a nice payoff to watch again now  im gonna give it 3 trashcan feathers 

if i waited 10 years maybe ill give 5 but for now 3 is the number 
 laughs 

okay so  this is  a  this films like a masterwork in tapping into whatever visceral aversion and disgust i have with the idea of being helpless and at someone s mercy 

someone mentioned earlier the rosemary s baby  like roe in that movie is completely helpless and whatever peoples kindness and james caan is at kathy bates kindness that turns out to be something else and he s confined to whatever she decides is best for him 

that s just horrifying  especially in this movie  there may be something to my reaction now on the phsycological level of being imprisoned to write something about what you dont give a shit about for th erest of your life but i wont get into that right now 

this movie is paced so well and most of it takes place in 1 room but you don t spend any boredome you want to sepnd more time to see the rooms and corners of the house kept hidden 

in a pacing term  any time i was getting too tense and i cant stand this anymore we got a buster break  which we shoulda named this movie out of  the richard farnswerth scenes were perfect levity for too much to stand 

okay  with all that said  i yeah  i agree that the michael meyers momenet at the end was hamfisted but even with that i gotta give 5 bitchly cow corns 
this was pretty good for a 1970s made for tv movie but that isnt saying very much 

i enjoyed watching this but it was definitely a 2 almost grabbed shards of glass for me  everybody said everything i was gonna say ripe ground to say 
i  this is the worst kind of review to give because if eel like i don’t hate it and i don’t love it  while i was watching it i felt like i was alluding to what jordan was feeling  antsy and rolling my eyes 

today i listened to the music and the closing credits was like  your bad in bed so your better off dead  just letting it stir in my brain and the cult status about it and what is enduring about it rose it in my estimation a bit 

i hate to be boring im right in the the middle here 3 beef for me 
mad with a lot of chewin away at my own self 

guys  i loved this shit  this is my jam  i really like this kinda story telling  i really like uh  daschell hammet and raymond chandler books 

this is good stuff for me 

yes  courtroom scene  i love all of the weird interjections of the peanut gallery  like the weird extras 

goober pile looking guy with his shirt tucked into his under pants that walks around and shouts  hey mike  mike   the whole movie 

yeah yeah  its good stuff 

yeah im into it  this is for me 

i found my 2009 college paper about this movie 

i will close my review with an exerpt from that 

 rita hellworths   hellworth s elsa is portrayed as weak earlyon in the movie  in contrast with michael the tough guy  however the true edgy nature comes through  elsa repeatedly asks michael for help to be damsel in distress as if she cant do things without the aid of a man 

put on bathrobe  put on coat on deck  immediately after she needs ohara s help with simple task of coat   shet akes control of ship and steers it  she has taken control of their relationship  

anyway  im gonna give this 4 sweaty excitable grisbees 
in the immortal words of nelson muntz  i can think of at least 2 things wrong with that title 

they thouht they were gonna see sex at a picnic and they got bugs and typewriters turning into dicks

i hate beatnicks and howl and gins and editing yourself as a sin and put down the first thing on the page 

however i love david cronenburg  what he made here is like a biography of a really intersting public figure mixed with drug addled hallucinations overshadowing his life and carerr 

the practical effects in this movie were just amazing  i was really enthralled anytime there was a puppet anytime on screen 

it touched on something in my 21 year old brain of like  thinking it was fun to explor movies that did weird shit that most movies dont do  digging through the stacks at the library or half priced books to find classic literature that was subversive or fucked up 

i really gotta kick out of it  felt like i was watching something 15 years ago and being excited by it and mezmerized like  oh movies can do this  

so i liked it  i give it 4 sips of mugwump jism 


ill make it quick

as someone who had no fun in his late teens and early 20s  this felt like something that was created and written by other people who had no funs trying to guess what it musta been like to go to a rave when you are 17 years old 

it just felt like a facsimilie or invitation of the idea of being cool in la doing drugs and going to clubs and stuff

like an imitation of tarantino or kids and stuff like that  it kinda came across to me as kinda safe late 90s things   shes all that  cant hardly wait 

shaggy   you are speaking my vibes buddy 

not dangerous

yeah i was like trying to joke and compare to family circus and connect to todd and family circus with sunday funnies but i couldnt figure out a way to bring that in but i will give this 2 crunchy herbal raves shits
i had the advantage of having seen it a few months ago so i could come into this without a sense of discovery  but rather a reevaulation 

i really respect and appreciate the character work in this movie  i think its really fun to watch all these people come to gether in the way that they do 

its not like a version of this movie that would be really awful and cringeworthy where you examine these damaged men seeking revenge fors omething that doesnt need avenging 

instead it takes these people and this idea this notion of chaos and nothing matters  the random acts of the universe  and spends something a little more sympatheic about it and these people are able to navigate the chaos and randomness of the universe together 

even though they do fucking horrendous things together and do french horn 

nuance to it  not just nialistic dopey going ons then i first realized i appreciate the work that went inna movie 

imma give 4 chubby salamis 

first of all im surprised we arent rating this based on professionally laundered shirt boxes that look like donuts 

but the screwdrivers is good too 

i think i watched this movie in 2006  like my first semester of college and i thought it might like it more now that im older but    i feel like the characters even thought they are more my age like  they act like little fuckin babies 

i was confused about how hold they were supposed to be cause they acted like they were in their 20s but looked like in their 30s 

it was uncomfortable and offputting  relationships and love triangle was the movie but it iddnt have a point of view about journalism integrity and objective reporting i dont thin kit really had a strong stance on that it doubled down on 

more like kind of a petty immature horny office culture that it was showing 

i was trying to wanted to bring this up in the conversation and neve really got into it did you want jane to end up with one of the guys or other 

biggest win is that nobdoy ended up together  that s a huge positive for the screeplay  because none of them belonged together or were good wfor each other 

i felt a bit annoyed throughout the movie with the characters and wanted to have a more point of view about th esetting or culture that it took place in but it didnt and that really bummed me out 

all i have to say it amountes to 2 screwdrivesr from concentrate for me 
i had this movie in my back pocket for a while and i was saving it for a movie club opportunity 

as i was watching it actively i had kind of a visceral disappointment reaction to it 

i was a little irritated that it wasn’t living up to some sort of preconcieved idea about what it was gonna be knowing joe dante directed it 

i guess i wanted the movie to be a little more out there and cooky  like more ascerbic and bitter  and then the next day after watching it i realized that s not what they were going for at all  more of a nostailgiac trip down memry lane as movie fans and 12 year olds 

my assessment of it was unfair as i came to realize 

with all that said   thought about some themes and jokes  talkin to you guys 

i think there were certain things  the score first and foremose  that score sort of deflated the best things about the movie 

so taking the jerry goldsmith outta it  i will hate to say it    will give 3 shopping cart uncles middle of the road movie 
technically and in terms of craft  it should be a 5 crowned brands movie  however i felt like it was asking way too much of me as a viewer 

it was like an every frame of the movie was a wheres waldo or i spy  it was work 

so  the effort and craft went into it were 5 crowned brands but i ended up walking away that it was a 3 crowned brands movie because i felt like i ran a mental marathon by the end of it 

as impressive and overwhelmingly well put together as it was  
i actually was  before i picked matinee  this was on the short list of movies for movie club  because i remember watching it in my class and liking it 

spoilers  i still liked it 

watching it i really enjoyed kinda going along for the ride with the characters and thinking about how stressed out or uncomfortable i would be in their shoes  which is not my idea of romance 

but i thought it was really interesting to see through their eyes  didnt remember it all  thinking jeff daniels was being such a piece of shit  but then the turn appreciated 

interest in audrey was not enough for me  thats my major nitpick with it  all that said  its a really fun ride johnathan dimmy rules  feelies was great  ray liotaa explode on screen 4 virginia for lubber t shirtsaswell 

ray liota explody as good phrase 

um 

misses doubtfire this aint 

i kept thinking about how in that movie they had a narrative device to explain why robin williams character was able to successfully pull off and convince people he was a woman 

in this they made no attempt  just a bit of shitty blush and no awareness of ridiculousness of that  so lazy nothing good to say about this im giving it 1 flawless cgi titty cup  thats all i can give 

this movie was very quizziting  i felt like i had never seen this movie before  but watching it still gave me the feeling of  oh i liked this movie when i was nine and i feel embarrassed that i liked it when i was nine 

everything to be said about mike meyers and his tim robbins haircut was annoying  couldnt see a character fall in love with 

movie is called  so i married an axe murderer  but he didnt marry an axe murderer  it doesnt deliver on it s promise 

the cameos phil hartman and other guy were great rest in peace fellas 

0 womans and 2 wooooomans   2 units 
i read last night a bit about the making of this movie  and there was something about how richard gere s performancing in this movie was pretty wooden and monotone and gary mashall explained in interviews that he gave richard gere the direction to play it that way to give julia roberts the opportunity to shine and not have a competitng presense with her 

i dont think i know better than gary marshell but i think that was a dumb decisions cause vivian falls in love with edward doesnt make sense hes awful in every way there s nothing that makes me see why she would like to go off with him at the end of this film i dont get it at all 

i have been getting texted by my boss this entire call and getting in trouble through work  im feeling very despondent and grumpy 

so well all that to say my world view is very negative right now i dont believe in love  i dont believe in this movie two steaming polo divits that is tempered with how i am feeling in this exact moment in time 
i can go next 

i don’t have a ton to say about this movie  which is a symptom for when a movie is objectively good in these conversations 

but i do echo a lot of what sam said  i will add to that into the long storied histroy of editories in cheif in movies and this one has a good one and i really liked him 

second only to audry hepburn  never seen her now i get it really enjoyed her 4 turthy hands inside a demon gods throat mouth mouth 
filmmaker has to say 

finally i can talk about this movie that i made 

yeah  watching this movie i had this feeling that there s probably a german word for i don’t know  its not second hand embarrassment… its like second hand vulnerability 

it just felt really  i felt very tender about john turturo opening up and exposing raw nerves  it was borderline uncomfortable in a lot of ways but also really sweet and dopey and earnest and endearing 

cause its just like  this guy is old enough to be my dad pouring his heart out into this weird fucking art who i could not imagine someone i know being unashamed to put something out there 

it was really funny too  there s a really interesting thing going on with a drama wher eyou want the actors to disappear into the role but instead it s stacked from top to bottom with people you know and thats a choice i appreciated 

the ending i had to rewatch cause i spaced out at the end and that was a raw nerve exposed on john tuturo and so dorky show everyone what s in your heart kinda thing 

i think specially after this discussion im feeling 4 cucumbers in a gardeners ass 
watching this movie made me feel like that praralegal taking a shit and the next stall over she could hear secretary lee masturbating 

i was confused at what was going on and not sure if it was supposed to be hot or not 

similar to hake  what i knew of this movie was an interview with conan obrien and showing the clip of him making her bend over the desk and smacking her butt 

i thought it was funnier than you guys thought this was  it seemed to be more intentionally going for a laugh in a lot of places compared to how the conversation acknowledged 

i think the two leads did a great job  disagreed with some of the script choices  my overall takeaway of it was that i was not like checking my watch  i liked this movie more than pretty woman so i gotta give 3 hairbrush spanks in the bathroom 
some of my favorite quotes from this movie 

 i ve had a belly fulla your cheap heroics  

i liked uh 

 flyboy hangs one my kisser and you let him waltz  

i have one more  and i can t find it now 

 we ve searched this place  from hell to breakfast 

my personal favorite 

 yeah  that s what i said  a rocket man 

everything s kinda been said over the past couple hours and during these reviews 

i really enjoyed these kind of neville trying to seduce jenny and she being like  yeah that s from this movie 

and then the celebrity cameos was like hail ceasar and the old timey reporters  talkin like this   and i really enjoyed that and felt the wholesomness of it and give it 4 slices of beamon s pepsin gum 

jordan  wow you really nailed it 
first of all i want to do know why johnson is drawring a pictuare of me hey did you guys know that romanians had red teeth and eat red meat  i think this movie has a good shot at winning a few jupies  it feels like a movie i woulda bougt sight unseen at walmart  dvd land 

i dont know this was uh
rough for me  i wish it
woulda just committed
to being a thing  it cou
lda been good if it
just admitted it was
funny as a comedy
if it just commited
to being creepy or
a disturbing comedy
it oculda been kinda good
it felt like poeple who were
making it just really wanted 
to make amovie but didnt
have an idea or a stroy they
were passionate about  i dunno

but i did get to see david hyde
pierce hump the air and cum
soth thats something 

so yeah im gonna also it was
90 minutes that goes
a long way for me so
imgonna give it 2
cheeky lil mystery

cheeky lil abrahmsz

the first two acts of this movie  if i had written them  i would be sooo pleased with myself  so proud 

i would do a friend table reading to show my crazy ideas 

the chicken s out a little bit because the axe murderer and nobody throws momma from a train 

i really liked danny devito in this movie  i liked the whole angle about being about writers  i was a mark for that  it worked on me 

i had never seen this before    alysia talking about it seems like something i woulda watche dover and over again as a kid if i knew or exposed to it 

maybe its the connection to other childhood movies i had with some of the performers and other stuff 

it tickled me  i liked it a lot  other than it chickens out at the end and wasnt as dark as it needed 

that was not enough of a gripe to give it 4 copies of mr guys 100 girls i d like to pork 
i watched this movie a long time ago  i was a diffrnt man then  uh  but uh  from what i can remember  i really liked it 

i will add to what sam said and i have a note here  that there s something i distinctly remember 

grodin that they wrote about grodin coulda been robin williams going over the top playing it for th eback oft he room and they went with grodin instead and i kept expecting him to jump up screaming and being a level 11 and he just remained charles grodin and that was really special and cool to me 

unlike the last movie we watched  someone got thrown from a train 

and uh  i yeah 

this is a movie you show freshmen in screenwriting 101 class  how you break a story beat for beat  tell a narrative through film im gonna give it 4 non counterfiet counterfiet 20s 
i did not wait to go for dramatic effect  it didn’t make me angry  but now i feel this is going to be not that interesting or climactic to the second to last review 

everybody said everything and it’s a perfect movie club movie its everything everyone is after and has iconic moments that will pop up randomly in my head forever 

why the hell is this movie only on youtube the only way a human can consume this film 

this movie is for the people 

i just think its a shame 

might be worth  70 for the dvd  just get criterion to make a blue ray 

for me its probably like 15 minutes too long to get a 5 star rating so im gonna do 4 day saving little piss pots tonight 
ill try to be fast 

im gonna call my mom tomorrow and thank her for not letting me watch this movie when i was a kid 

i cant think of the last time that i turned against a movie so quickly  that fucking christmas carol bulllshit made me hate this movie in the first 90 seconds 

you need to lose that stuff  it has nothing to do with the movie and it soured my whole vibe 

theres really cool set design  interesting ideas  ll cooljay  michael gambon killing it 

but ultimately berry levinson saw brazil and was like  im gonna do that 

it made me fee frustrated and bummed out for specifically ll cooljay  i was like im sorry man  you worked really hard and did such an incredible job and yet it was this 

because my heart hurts for ll cooljay i have to give this movie 1 pea and carrot in a problematic puke pile 
i think i told sam that iw as planning to split this movie up into two nights and never did that  i endd up staying up relaly late to finish it 

i enjoyed this a lot it got me thiniking about things i don’t  really think about  when i started talking about crickets  i realized im more into animall kingdom and biology and the historical relevance and the conversation 

this was one of the more engrossing conversations ive had about a movie and this adds a lot of clout to the movie in my mind  i didnt have the trouble with the second half as you ahd  it becoming dour and gloomy was just representative to what happened 

i was invested to the end 

soooo im gonna urinated on the side of the bowl be curteous god 

so uh 4 turds in the bowl from a piss joke to a shit joke 
there is an alternate universe somewhere where a bunch of sctv people where different characters in that 

this reminded me of all those like… waynes world and superstar  that feeling of strain designed to stretch characters out into a feature  and there is also that underlying charm where at least the comedians really love their character  and there s some quality to it where you feel endeared to the whole project because the leading actors are performers in it also 

i dont have a lot to say about it that we havent already said  it s like the kind of movie that you cover in 2 hours  while i and most of us loved rock morainis  he also loved dave thomas growing up which i feel like revealed a lot 

anyway  3 out of 5 2 minute pisses in a loony bin 
alright ill jump in 

this is a good example of a movie that couldn’t have happened if 9 11 hadnt happened 

its very reactionary to the state of public emotion and the feeling that was going on in media in the 5 years after that 

its gonna sit high on that list of movies that are like  yeah this is a relic of that time 

i kept wishing that this movie was more invested in showing us a world where there was almost a utopia happening at the expense of human emotion  so that there was some sort of conflict of choosing something at 

there s no stakes like yeah topple this fuckin regime it fuckin sucks  then i realized that i was not supposed to think about it that hard 

its supposed to be cool to 17 year olds in 2003  so then that head space made it work 

so i had a lot of fun watching it and it was more than i had in the sense something i could have watched with all of you guys 

so when i give it 2 taye diggs faces on a marble floor  know that its not coming from a place that i didnt have fun with it  it does 
dustin checks in 

ive been putting this off  this is like still i gotta gow ith my gut  i cant believe they made the simpsons episode  homer at the bat  into a feature length film 

whole time i watchin this i was picturing sam at 6 7 years old being enthralled by it 

its so adult  theres not much whimsy to grasp on to as a kid  then i tried to think about what is my equivalent to that 

a lot can pass over you as a kid if you have something to hook your brain into for me it was th ebaseball 

im not a mark for sports movies necessarily its not a surefire thing im not completely sold on it 

the best parts of this movie were the baseball parts for sure 

everything inbetween was kinda a slog for me if it wasnt baseball or wilford brimley 

it took me 4 hours to watch because of all the non baseball parts  like why did the lady shoot and why was robert redford so old 

im glad i saw this but it did not win me over like it did you guys and i feel bad about it  i wanted more base ball more magical realism and 30 minutes less movie 

im gonna give it 2 poison little morsel tartlets 

im happy i seen it and its objectively a good movie 
i was trying to think of a way to sing 

i ve given you batman 

i ve given you mant 

looks like you re not happy  unless it s a plant 

i don t give a free
pass to musicals 

i think most musicals are shit 
for most movies i would list 
en to an album over and over

these songs are very resonent
with me forever  got
incredible puppetry and my
boy rick moranis 

ellen green 

sci fi
movie 
throwback  its a stew of things that
easily has a place in my heart 
easy mark for it  living in my head
rent free for many years  easily 5
gliterly lilly funeral arrangements 
shags favorite woody allen movie is ants 

ill go  i will say   i would like to revisit antz  i havent seen it since 7th grade   ill pick it  ben  

followed by bee movie 

horny bees 

okay ill go ahead and go 

johnson your reasoning for picking this movie really resonated wiht me because my dad doesnt really care about many movies other than jeremiah johnson and dances with wolves  but i never got to see it growing up 

it my head it was always a steve felton movie 

i felt sentimental about it having never seen it 

all the marketing around the movie and the way the characters think about buck is that hes a complete piece of shit   transformation from terrible person to redemptive arc family man who cares about his nices and nephews     but no  it was like he was shut out of a family life he actually did care about and john candy was perfect for that role 

hes not gross  hes not a shithead  you are cheering for him and i lvoe that 

its not flawless  but and i have talked about a lot of the hiccups and things that diddnt age well but  it did just kinda i kinda was able to be wrapped up in it pretty easily and getting by on the charm of it alone and what i had built up in this movie in my head i was in a cozy spot  so i give it 4 gnat circumcising hatchets 


this movie  office space  rules  i think it s been said  makes me want to dance with two of my coworkers in a shitty apartment over hiphop music 

ive only seen it 2 other times since this viewing  2 years ago i watched my parents watch it on christmas   my dad sleeps through everything and he stayed awake the whole time   must be at minimum a 4 bob movie to keep dad felton awake 
i cant believe we got through this whole night without talking about the firey cup 

we didn’t talk about firey cup 

 cross talk about fire on tummy and hands burning green 

dang 

i just had to get that in there  because it was my last shot

this was like uh  it had a lot of charm i think i made a reference to it  kind of felt like jaden and some of the other child stars had a quality to their performances and the writing behind it felt like something froma  decade earlier and before  but it had some of the prat falls of movies from 2010ish where it looked like it was shot and edited from 2010  had the runtime of a 2010 movie 

had baggages and everyone touched on that 

the moment i pressed play i knew it was gonna end on a freze frame and it ended on a freeze frame so im gonna give it 3 jackets up with attitude 
im gonna be succinct too  been beautiful how pithy you all have been  of all the watchowski movies that explain away everyday minutia as some kind of science fiction phenomenon and end with the main characters flying away 

this is definitly the worst  im gonna disagree with mila and say that more money coulda save this and give it 1 space roller blade 
 in a souther twang 
this movie was a real doom 

let me tell you  i always say  a man can be anything except a police man  what can i say  they are just so stuipd  i cant tell you how stuipd they are 

i think it has been evident in this conversation  this was kind of a tough hang  this had some real  from justin to kelly  vibes 

i struggled in the last hour  i forgotten a lot of the last hour  im sorry 

but i did hang in there and i did watch it in one sitting  that s why i forgot 

all in all  i m gonna have to land on 2 removed glasses all told 
if you had shown me a still image of inu oh in long arm form and played one of the rock songs for me  i would have immediately given it a 5 

i watched the entire thing  and especially in first 20 minutes had hard time following the plot 

the constant leaps forward in time made it difficult to follow 

once it became a concert film like woodstock or something  i was fully in  the animation is next level  i love hand drawn animation  i love the character designs  inu oh s long arm was awesome  i listened to the soundtrack today twice while working 

i liked it a lot 

so    it only jumped down 1 star for all the troubles i described  4 cursed elongated arms for me 
with this one i ve considered the gamut  every end of the spectrum 

for my birthday i really want a poster of the koopa kissing that baby 

i also didn’t get a chance to show everyone my issues of my 7th grade comics 

shows comics 

so that will tell you that i have an adolescent affienity for this stuff 

i have this uh  inexplicable fascination with this move because ive only seen it one time since i saw it for movie club second time 

been listening to podscasts with what went wrong and different things that never came to be  i just had a weird investment and or interest in it and when i was 5 super mario bros was the shit and the happy meals that came out 

but watching it again for this event  i had a lot of thoughts about it  i had a lot to say about it  i was really fired up about how i tried to write a movie when i was in 6th grade and it maybe was better than this one i dont know   

but uh  i can t  i can t extricate the badness of this movie with my fascination with it 

it was very entertaining to me and i was very sucked into it and sucked into the world and admiring some of the set design and the animitronics and swing for the fences performances like fiona shaw 

i think if you called it something other than super mario brothers 

really interesting  kids movie with kinky stuff going on and anti cop stuff and i dunno its just a really interesting little relic of 90s hollywood like how did this happen  so after much consideration im gonna give it 4 screaming martini worms 


well 

ill try and be short 

i will review this through the pointed view of the last time i saw it when i was 6 years old 

my dad took me to see jurrasic park and i wasn’t even scared  it was so awesome and cool and good 

then i saw we re back a dinosaurs story and it was way scarier  professor screw eyes was very scary and gave me bad dreams 

2 circuses which are a notion with some spiiiice 
i m sad that i couldn’t see my 2009 review of this movie  sam and jordan have my number 

i lapped this up like a glass of hot milk on a summer evening 

its really really fun for me to watch this and try to parse all of the influences and origins of these filmmakers and think about their collaberation with barry sonnenfeld and sam raimie and piece all of that together 

i dunno i find this to be areally riveting southern greasy  sweaty  nasty comedy of errors and i    i really dig it  i m into it  this gets 5 curtainless windows from ry ry 

sam  5 warm bowls of summer milk 
as i was watching this movie i coined a new literary term that nobody has ever heard of called  show don’t tell 

the first 45 minutes of this movie it just told me all that stuff and i found it fucking unforgivable and it grated on me so badly 

why couldnt this movie just told this to me in linear fashion instead of ethan hawke vomiting exposition at me for almost an hour 

i couldnt get over that  the rest of the movie did not feel earned cause that so it gets 2 chickenshit michaelphelpses brothers

cool 

for my review im going to quote the wize words of eddy rabbit  testin my resistance and its wearin mighty thin  got the feeling i should leave before the roof caves in and i feel the need to hold you close and love the night away while you are turnin me every which way but loose 

i really liked the orangutan  he was great  i struggled with everything else  it kinda just melted from my brain  so much of it disappeared from my mind  but it was fun to talk about and clyde rules   so im gonna give it 2 pissens shittens fartens and ass kickens
