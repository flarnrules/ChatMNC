 tight little production  said sam  
 looser movie   said hake 

two black fades   
stand by original statement  fun watch  loved those aspects of it  the growth of watching rich white people complain and not have an emotional arc… so many movies i love are white people complaining but this one doesn’t get to the point  doesnt land  but still enjoyed it  3 dead  hard 3  came in 3 left with 3
fanboy of this guy  it totally beat my expectations  you cant make a feature  challenge to see what he could do  low expectations  didn’t make bigger statement  marking and comedy in general  much deeper commend did not land end of the day making something original hake and i irianian director even close to making have to give it 4 slaps by body builder  originality and enjoyment
stuck between 2 and 3  part enjoyed visuals  part was real bored  wants to like it more based on like being nice to the movie  but my gut reaction was a two  two dresses getting shot off the maids  man there were some tired old tropes i dont want to see in art house films
don’t use this film to beat up other films  i watched this with my old coworkers from the 40s  i put in two oldies but goodies  crazy week  i walked into this conversation thinking im gonna give ita  3  now talking more about it  goign through notes how 1 noted all the cast members were  continued to go everyone is 1 dimensional  building this straight for no nuance  no reality  gotta stand by my principals that theres not much good other than  hang out  charmyness of ireland
5 spiked cigarettes for the fight scene
my critique is that what we ended on  i wish they would have grounded the old man in the relationship  more hesitant  felt weird  to echo what sams said  i didn’t like arc of mom  instantaneous realization  man i now see the light  there wasnt an acceptence  little girl great  little prince great  fox great  overall  very rewarding  if i had kids  great this is a movie that deals with some concepts totally on board  positive 3 baobab trees  in between an 3 and a 4
theres not much more i can probably say tha tyou havent all touched on  i think we paused it to all pee or something  i am loving the clip its moving at  don’t know where its gonna go in best or worst way  was a blast to watch  that’s a 1 like bruce lee  there s nothing about this movie that was   i was entertained  this was not jupider ascending  this had a little bit of heart  the relationship between the two of them  everyonce in a while steven segall works  kinda funny  2 like bruce lee but betters to be the middle man
this movie was the definition of pretention  taking metaphors and bringing higher meaning into anythign  sucks when you have literal pretentiousness  dialouge felt like an 18 year old film school dude watched this  a dude watched a tarantino movie and cohen brothers movie i know what movies are  hard 1  directing a script was not in the cards for this guy 
ive seen dog fight scene and hairgel scene  crazy how little i know about screenshots or whatever  yeah we said al ot about this movie t here s some funny funny parts  car scene  beggingin scene  end scene  johnanthon richman scenes  puttin them in th emovie  i couldnt get over the male gaze of this movie  womean are just pedastals that ove sports sex toys rachel got pissed about this movie cant we just watcht his movie  your cutting me off we had a have a whole conversation i was not trying to cut you off ben stiller we gotta watch more it was a whole thing  it ruined a good evening  i couldnt get over the male gaze of the movie which like sucked  man the women characters just sucked  theres movies from the 90s where they know how to write a female  the arc of the gnlish speaking architect changing to a pizza dude even if it didnt work logically i love love loved that whole scene  the fact that she went to ben stiller totally made sense for the time period  would it have been btter i dont know o herees your keys that coulda been a funny bit 2 testicals above the penis
the only way this can move up to 1 dimple pie is if the ending is totally fucked up  it iddn t do it so zero 
hake  i think this movie would mean you are siskle and ebert john romero
sam  johnson doesn’t like the sex and violence 
daniel  um  so yeah we talked a lot well actually im going to talk about al ot i knew about this dustin deverette from bayonette had an awesome poster from his work custom made poster always knew abou tit from that the production design of b w homerun  it was so well done  everytime it went b w i was mesmerized  to echo johnson with the pacing  i wrote down    so slow   but i like   i liked how it was building up to something but it felt purposeful  minsu the church looking thing   buildup slow pacing bad payoff  beautiful  issue   resistance  felt likesuch a rag tag aspect but it just didnt pay off  because  i felt like it could have been one small scene to flesh them out a bit more  and hten it would of made sense  i cam e in definitely going like this ia four but i painted with ryan today and we were talking abou tit and 3 pairs of sunglasess  i still love it  lub it  charts 3 so much love  not a bad one  
um  so yeah  this was like a random pick because ive always wante dto watch it people talking about it on hereditary  serious watch  i agree with a lot of you  the literal and story aspect left a lot to be desired  makes up a lot in its symbolism  not going to take anything at straight value  what it is trying to say with that  once i got my brain on  venice in late fall winter gorgeous time to film  reif  talking about murders being around  i liked the idea of the murders just being around in the setting  this midget is still a representation of the daughter his greif that murdered him  his greif of his daughter murdered him  murders by chance  in on that  donald  julie christie  she was pretty good  totally enjoy it  overall dug it  good horror art film in the 70s  4 likcs of d suth toopazed mustache
jordan  you kinda went through my journey  

sam  i love this guy  he s 20 years old  jj redick  mcroberts   

um  so  yeah overall really loved the movie  loved the journey  like jordan said  when it switched to the second half  it lost me for a second but i got on board again  then    because of the ending and the way it built up to that it was a bold choice  the scream bringing it back  i thought was fantastic  you thought it didnt matter but it did  when it ended  oh  it kind of washed over me i kinda thought this film was basically the main character findingt he truth in something and prove that i found the truth but really this is about filmmaking  you think what you are making is the truth  you are trying to show that to the world  john travolta is the filmmaker  this is the truth  no its not  in denial  this film is showing at the end  the scream that gets used in the terrible b movie is literal truth  no matter how bad or good  there is a glimmer of truth in every film that has been made  

jack terry s whole journy is the journey of every filmmaker  you think capital t truth but really you only make a b horror movie you originally thought was truth but it is something  5 fucking 5  what 5     5 screams  thassa good scream  wat       this isa masterwork of filmmaking it said the things it needed to 
um  yeah going into this movie on sunday night i didn’t have any expectations other than it was jj abrams from johnsons text  i thought war zombie movie  went in with low expectations  probably enjoyed most of it  agree with most of our conversation on the flaws  at end of the day  ended well was breezy  parts that worked worked well as an action movie  yeah i dont  have much else to say  have to give it 3 rotten sons of bitches 

jordan  hake   not a zombie movie  hake  reanimated super solider movie 

shag  without tibbit would be worse  loved tibbit  tibbit gets it 

sam  tibbit playing cards with the kid was tight 

everyone  tibbit 
i m watching these dodgers about to come back from a 7 4 deficit  it s 8 7  that was an amazing rally  it was so good  so good  mookie bets 

sam  i ve decided next year i m going to get back 

shag  they made a movie  they completed a thing  i m very proud of them for making a movie  paying people  watching this in 2020 was like real rough  we have learned the art of telling stories with more depth and nuance than this  this movie i was on my computer  my phone as much as as i was watching this movie  i do appreciate the opening  then the juxtopisition of the party at th bbq  so strong  thought they would lean more into that  mayb eyou guys picked up more than i did 

path of female now shes just an object  but like um  yeah it was just en dof the day so heavy handed   

not a big body horror dude  it was just rough  so  2 eaten hearts out of a hand 
missed some convo this is a movie where the conversation is better than the movie itself  fun to talk about  sad i missed the sex scene talk  going to town with the underwear on again  whoooooo  she is like a robot 
ben   shes tall man 
sam   inappropriate joke 
shag  so the conversation about this movie great i suffered from watching this movie middle of the day on monday because the front part of the week is so busy so i just had to fit it in it was a lunch movie not time of day good  beginning was hilariously confusing with the double house blow up  sort of doing an adventure not explain 
so much heart in all of the good guy characters  sadly the female was not fleshed out well at all 
the tall man and his minions  great villian 
take away a lot of scenes from this movie in my head in a positive head  as a whole 
this is  uh  double quad shotgun 
cool  um  i watched this with erin and joe at their house  wish i could have paid more attention to that  this is a doc style that i love  the fly on the wall hangout doc… they aren t made as much anymore… i drew some comparsons of the vibe  paris is burning 
vibe is the same  hanging out in the scene to let them know about this amzing thing is happening  beautifyl bceause no agenda  we think this thing is so cool  no agenda to it  just need to dcument the people doing and you will be totally encompassed by th ething they are doing  i love a doc that knows wen to cutt off 
loved the ending  him retiring  felt like  the last dance  coming off  the last dance   docs knew when to do it cause it was the peak of arnold  not a lot of critiques as a movie    not a lot of conflict or other stuff    super solid as docs go  4 people if who are dogs would bite people  

for dogs by dogs 

lol
so yeah this conversation has been great i m so happy this went this well 

picked it not knowing a whole lot about it  it is in the criterion collections  oh young resse witherspoon  young matthew broderick this could be fun 90s mtv movie  i think it delivered on  it was way more creative than i thought this movie ever could be 

noone is wholly good or wholly bad  it is very eastern philosophy  characters have flaws  good  bad stuff  they brought this to that movie  it was so much fun to walk 

one more thing we havent talked baout  ahead of this time dealing with priveleged white men  midwest white men that don t deal with any diversity they think they can deal with anything  i agree with johnson the statutory rape was offputting  the way they took him down so quickly 

the slow demise was fun to watch of matthew broderick  can do it all piss in front a a tree and cehat on his wife because of the color of his skin and his gender because they were in omaha  this movie was swimmin in trim  paul for the win  4 juicy fruits outta fishy bowls 

sam  hot offa presses
i agree with hake and sam and a lot of whateveryone said 

i did hit a wall with this movie  once i knew how bad acting and style  you kinda hit a wall where it s like oh we gonna continue this  it wrapped up you were fatigued by the end of this movie 

once you get away from it  i realized this movie is not meant for me  the story it was tyring to tell i knew nothing about  i was an outside individual  i took that into watching this thing and um  at the end ofthe day i was doing the same thing jordan was  i was researchingt he real story and what it did we talked so much about th ereal individuals and the real scene  in the end it succeeeded what it wanna do 

at the end of it thats unfair  i think it did what it neded to do  3  money success fame and glamours 
i watched this in highschool at least once or twice and i remember it being decent  but not loving it  we rewatched it and i understood 100  why 

i think there was a lot of   i t was funny  it was  a very funny movie when it comes to everyones portrayals  i remember cage being more unhinged in my brain  but that pulled me back in my enjoyment  like we talked about the skinsuit  i wanted more cage 

i felt like the buildup was a bits low bfore the heist happend  i loeved the cops  the villan was terrible  they did not write him well at all and i was very dissapointed with the villan  i remaner the villan being better 

the score was a big pet peeve of mine becuase it just forced you to feel things that the acors were not doign 

at the endo fth edat it was a blast to watch loved the characters in the buildup  this is not gonna get a juipe for review  2 lazercutpoopiedogkeesthatigotmyjollysoffwith 

i remember talking with hake and accidentally watching early 2000s movies and i must just have a weird i just dont get the aesthetic  it sucks 
clears throat 

to echo a lot of us  i thought the intro was very exciting  i was very excited to watch a period piece  it set us up to watch a funny and satiracl period peiec about how wealth treats sex and each other 

lacking consistency  lacking tone  is this funny  is this serious  the movie  the favorite  was better 

once i thought about  the favorite  i realized this movie was bad 

the last act was strong  jordan made a comment earlier  it ended too quick and was getting good with the war betweeen the two but ended with swordfight  end was battle of ugliest two beign like  to sex or not to sex  to manipulate or not to manipulate 

this movie deserves 2 double wig malkovitchz  monolith here 
i have second leaset bond experience  this is also my first pre pierce brosnan bond in full  which is ridiciulous  i know 

at least i was getting into it where i knew this was gonna be a rough one 

multiple choice question 

was sean connery the very first bond 

y 

n 

i knew this one was bad 

he got  1 2 big ones in 1971 to do this movie  it cost  7 big ones to make it 

i have yet to see a more phoned in movie performance wise than this  this was insane how little anyone gave a shit when the cameras were rolling  i was like   

what  am i watching 

everyone from the bottom to the top gave a shit about this movie    and you could tell  as a viewer you begin to not care along with everyone else   

but it is a fun watch 

i do admit that the moon scene we rewatched was fantastic 

the moonbuggy with the tricycles   

shout out to irish   italian funeral boys  the beginning part of the movie was all fine 

conversation did not disappoint 

2 moonbuggies with plenty o tooles
i was really excited to watch this because i havent watched one in a while  excited to watch baseball  old school film   at that 

right of the bat i nkew i was super excited  the hand held camera and long takes gave it some realness and authenticity that iwas just really excited about 

and  i lvoed how timeless this was with the kids just wanted to hav efun  that was just super timeless 

loved that  and 

when i was thinkin about it this mirrored real life in a lot of ways with um   

noone goes through a huge transformation 
 sports movie 

the people in power will always win in life

but if you just have fun  drink a beer and enjoy the ride you can be the actual winner and that was the message 

im gonna give this movie 4 cruds  its not the adjective  its the noun 

jordan  foul  for wrong scoring system

sam   supports jordan 

shag  4 cruds
i think it would be better if i go  lump me in with this group  johnson at the end witches wild card kevin talk…

i am in the hake and sam camp where i was excited to at least try and appreciate this film for what it was  gorgeous visual journey  rachel we gonna watch this at the cinema 

the beginning the acting was such a choice  then it just kept making decisions in which it lacked creativity and the pacing wore on me even thought i have thick skin for that 

the music  the visuals anammorphic lenses was incredible everyone looked amazing 

at the end of the day the symbolism was too heavy handed and i think i hate this director and its a white man directing a movie about women so fuck off dude  2 trifecta cannibals 
ill echo jordan in a certain aspect i thought we were going to get something over the top adnventure cringe movie 

instantly th etone was differnet 

iw as like oh what am i getting into 

theres been my main comfort movie that i talk about alot the asthecis same music same i instantly thought i knew this movie bcase that it was acted oddly well 

you believe them

i loved how it was shot

i agreed with sam about austrailia chill enough dipped toes

new york movies had some issues overall it was great

i am on the side of th efence that at the end where it jumped the shark i agree with ben becuase it jumped the shark at the right time  i loved the fact that it was chill early  3rd act was breath of fresh air for me  i was gonna i m gonna give it 4 frostythrownoffacuppa
 dresses as cornholio 

sam  talks about clowns 
jordan  says dance floor 

shaggy 

so i have to   agree with um  everyone else  sorry i am buying a house  

 purchases house 
 puts in offer 

um  i agree with everybody who has gone  i was really kind of thinking of more thought out humor but it was    the same gag for all of 80 minutes which got old and i was bored  but talking about it with you guys was a hell of a lot of fun to remember 

watching with headphones and a laptop is not the way th emovie should be digested  the soundtrack was great 

the peyote scene was great  happy we rewatched that 

juxtaposed against the rest of the movie it made it stand out even stronger because of that 

came in thinking 1 star but the conversation and cultural impact it had i cant give it 1 this is 2 a couplalittle spider monkeys





i did not realize we had that tally just overally point 

so  i  whenever you pick your movie you are just nevous about who people are going to receive it  im not nervous anymore about picking the movie and receiving now im worried about the conversation 

idid i pick the right movie for wednesdays 

its the hang movie  are we gonna talk about this

i thoguht ensamble case maby this is a fun movie tongith it jsut pvroved like yeah t was a blast to alk about and wednsasdays are amasizing ie can pic anymovie and you gusy rbougth up so much stuf fi ddint aent sthink about but like we do this thing with each other

vusuall and usually i hate like heavy handed metaphors and this move rboguth them over and over

we had the angel
kevin klin floatin around
heavy handedness

why do i like this 

robert altman brings a direction and he is like me in the way i can just appreciate the laid backflow of it 

sam brought up the rollin cigarettes 

champaign poppin into ra

you mix the authetnticty i will easily swallow heavy handed metahpors all these movies have this you can tell they havin fun and its real

i had no prairie home companion knowledge bfore 

my scandidanvian heritage

is it perfect no  but i give 4 failed rolled cigarettesy by the one and honly kevin kline
i don’t have a lot to say about this movie because we talked a lot about it 

my main thoughts was 

it was jarring at first poppin into this dubbed sphagetti western world  which i don’t hav ea lot of experience watching westerns 

once i settled in  i really fell in love with the scene and the world it created  especially th emain characther 

revisiting the fight scenese made me  hand held cameras gave some authenticity to this fake world 

i loved some of those action scenes  it was funny but at the same time the main character had a lot of grit and a lot of interesting character vibes going on 

i can see the influence  i can see why people chose this as a way for making future movies 

ive been watching a lot of sun dance movies and i had to watch this in two parts  i was so excited to return to the world of django 

something about watching a movie from 1966 i just had to jump in gonna ive it 4 coffins that were once filled with a machine gun but was now filled in gold 

a lot of holes to shoot bullets out of
um 

ill try to keep this review simple

overall i think i enjoyed the watch of this film maybe more than the rest of indivduals 

i don’t have a huge anime backlog  that being said  the animation  i viewed through a nostalgiac lense 

i kind of oddly enjoyed the animation of this movie  not bcause it was good but because it was a moment in time

the movie endd and i was trying to figure out a lot of the symbolism 

im excited to let this stew  to figure out more of what they are going for 

then this conversation happened  nothing came to me  nothing came to you guys  robots  singularity 

when i got done with this film my gut reaction was a 4  but then 3 5 we dont do half so 3 uncles who dont give a shit about their nephews 

i really liked the music that was not big band but it was big band  glen miller white people but actaully not

i enjoyed th emusic choice  this was very cowboy bebop  rebop of cowboy bebop rebop of cowbop 

that main cowboy bebop theme 

jordan butchers cowboy bebop theme

japan is obsessed with jazz music  there is a whole storyline in treme about a trombone  etc 

movie night swag 
this is the firs tmovie i brought to movie club that i have seen 

against my usual pricinpals 

because zina has been watchign so many nb movies i was thinking aout his early stuff and how much fun 

kicking and screaming i hated in college  i was like these guys are bimbos but in 2016 i was like fuck   we are these people  i became these people 

perspective is everything  mr jealousy was hard i had to buy the dvd on ebay back in 2016 or 2017 when i originally watche dit 

its been a minute its been like 4 years  i remember watchign it and digging it and understanding the flaws 

why not bring it to movie club 

it was a super enjoyable watch i was like oh man are we going to to be able to talk about this are people going to like this 

at th eend of the day i loved peoples insights talking about it 

the therapy sessions and its comment on therapy  i really loved i felt like it was fun he came to therapy as a lie but they all benefited kinda from it  i loved the hyperbolic nature of this movie everything was extreme and exaggerated 

it caused noah b to go in a hole for 8 years 

um  my logical brain wants to give it a 3 but my personal enjoyment is easliy a 4  group therapy sessions by peter bogdonovich 
i have never gone first 
mars attacks  very excited to watch this moovie  because ive never seen it  i didn’t even know tim burton directed this movie 

this movie seemed like an snl skit that was in movie form  watching the cast i was pretty pumped  it was a cultural moment that i missed when i was kid  and when i watched this i was like    this is a reverse allegory for our treatment of the native americans 

mars comes in is like  we wanna be your friends  oh wait never mind we are going to murder all of you 

then i found out that the song that saved everybody was called  the indian love call  and the fact that the kid that won looked like a native american and was from a military family and made a tee pee reference and i was like oh my god  tim burton

then we looked up the cards and i wa slike    oh tim burton was just referencing some cards  

all jokes aside  i do think tim burton was playing with a lot of things and at the end of the day he liked subverting everything  whether that was our treatment of the native americans  action movies  being a first rate movie star at 96  he sprinkled it in everything and at the end of the day i wanna hang out and party with tom jones for real  this was 3 attacks on mars  by mars  sorry 
i will give a review from my mouth rather than my butt 

super interesting pick  arguably the most art house film we have done by far 

it was a collage  which i respect 

happy i saw it 

it was interesting i watched it i was very tired 

my biggest takeaway from this film was an aspect i was trying to read into it but sam said dont analyze it too much my takeawy was the opposite of  the phrase  everything looks perfect from far way 

i say everythign looks perfect zoomed in  sex is perfect zoomed in sex manifesets itself through politics whether thats communism or the american dream

for me when i lose s dr recih politics american paradoxiacal maybe he was getting do that point maybe you cant extrapolate even a human truth human politics or communism east v west you can i dont know where im going with thsi blah blah blah 3 sex balls soccer balls 3 sex balls vibes thats where i am 
happy quiet man day 

had no idea about this movie  had no idea about how little of films henry sellick directed  stop motion takes a long time 

when i saw he directed i was like this is crazy and i hav eno idea about this movie 

we presesed play it started happening it was a 2001 movie where its between 1990s and 2000s which is a weird vibe 

once we got downtown i was like    cool i get where we are going  but overall it just didnt explore it enough

it was bad  brendan frazier was at some parts had quircky cartoon comic book drawler but also he tryin to be married  it didnt wrk 

but then chris katan come and save the day  it was a 5 5 star scene in this movie  most brilliant snl skit in your life 

at the end of the movie rachel was like was that so good and then misdirect  amazing scene  this holds up isolated organ donor organ donor team gymnast take it out and so good  this movie had a lot of potential 

this is the quintessential wednesday night movie  this is why we get together  this is why we talk about movies  this is why we do this  so good so bad at the same time  2 kidneys out of dead kris katan 
i was very excited about jordans selection of magic mike 

ive heard a lot of allure around the series  and in hindsight i relize its around the second one  i kne what to expect 

i did not expect a real movie  halfway through i was like they are trying to make a real geunine indy moive 

i was like this is supposed to be one thing

the hoook around this love hate relationship with this movie i wa slike they try to make indy movie about male strippers in florida but there are bad steps and cliches they made such as the drugs the sidekick ya know 

overall the heart was there  we realized the heart was there in the rgiht place you gotta appreciate the performances overallwere great except the kid

because of that love hate relationshipwith this im so excited for this next one but i was happy i watched it and im a soderburt fan

churnin shit out like iphones all the time because of love hate relationship it gets 3 catfuls of ghb
so this is my pick 

i was torn about picking this movie i was the firs tone pick off season 8  i remember all of you alls watching it and i wish it was with you 

it dips the toes into the arthouse cinema waters but the minute i pressed play i was like okay  we will hav ea lot to stalk about this was my second time watchin 

the second time watching it i was like this is a beautiful film about male friendships dealing with a middle aged rut

martin  adolescent kids wife emotionally far away

nicolash  new kids so eh was in a rut

peter  never in deep relationship

tommy  divorced

all delt with male middle aged ruts well minus peters in a great way a fantastic part of this movie 

its story of alchohol is beautiful  its realistic  you got for 4 friends who deal with alchohol in a celebratory way but we can f up our lives a little bit but one of them doesnt know how to    its a realistic story and i love that 

is alchohol gonna ruin our lives  no  gonna make us fuck up some shit  yeh 

gotta give it 5 with a point in front of it b a c 
low budget movies thrive in traditional indy fair 

coming of age  romantic comedy  and then… sci fi

i was excited about this being a sci fi movie  open to different reality  different dimensions 

first act came in super heavy with how exciting this movie can be 

i think this conversation fleshed out ideas that could make this movie 110 times greater than what we watched 

at the end of the day this movie had some great performances 

it iddnt stick the landing  i gotta put it in perspective  im happy they are making movies like this the director is working  i dont think ill return to it i am happy i watched it 3 out of extraordianry pillow fights three of them
i cannot count  ever 

so ive seen a loto f this guys directors movies  this guys movies  because of that bulter screen we did  i like a lot of them but hes enver done a complete homerun for me but hes made some… off ones 

this guy is like a very prolific filmmaker and this was his horror  and it was regarded as a very interesting movie when it came out 

a lot of things have already been said  but i felt like he brought a lot f his mello drama and convoluted drama about this extrastraneous bs but this one makes it worse 

it could have been a simple film about grief and loss and make it stronger 

he has to make a lot of movies 

what if  we had this crazy plastic surgeon that reverses a guys sex  without his consent  isnt that crazy 

lets reverse engineer the story 

rape  ok what would make someone so made but oh have this wife run away 

he had a good idea and he reverse engineered  antonio banderaze was great gift to screen his face 

im gonna give this 3 nonconsentualvanginalplasties

very bummed i had to come in so late  we were running an event really late for erin  haron college  iupui  erin herin 

bummed i had to miss the beginning of the conversation  thank you hake for picking this movie  theres a lot of allure around thsi movie that id idnt even know about it 

i feel like this movie was picked at the right time  casavetti and malaya nd enjoying the language of 70s filmmaking  the verite filmaking style and the vignettes were fantastic  felt documentary style 

and then  um  i loved how these characters were never redeeming  we are just going to show these guys down and out  they dont even value their lives  they are trying to get out kindof  but the film showed they are half heartedly trying to get out 

this movie was like  well lets just give them a game sot hey have meaning again even they dont have anything to live for  speaking with safety brothers they would be this movie is the fucking beast 

characters that dont mean anything but im gonna tell their story anyways 

the lack of exposition i was totally down for  i dont need any of that  this movie has aged because they dont fill gaps  theres so many holes  holes make for great conversation to argue about what they mean  room to think about what that means  filmmakers that let the audience think about things compliments the audiences ability to think about things and not be strapped into a box and in hindsight i loved this movie it was  blah blah 4 drips of nitroglycerine 70s movie rule they are so good  i was in it 
coming off of reifs review  i 100  agree i thought this movie was a lot more fun and funny than i was planning on 

i couldn’t tell whether it was purposeful  but in turn it was fun  like the main character we all talked about he seemed like a goofball but at the same time he had it all together 

as a lot of peopl eliked this movie and liked the dub  i was excited to watch it because i loved django  it was such an immediate disappointment when the kid was narrating 

when he stopped and we got to live in the moment  the kid just kept pulling me out and it was so anti what the original filmmakers were trying to do   so that was tough 

this was a nice seguay to sorcerer  i love it it had the 80s music but over explanation 

here s sorcerer that did it more my style shogun assassin had the same ingredients but didnt do it my style 

the women were my favorite and the kimono eject button got 5 swords  im gonna give this 3 ballz 
driven 

this is what movie nights are made for  i feel like i pressed play on this movie after being on the track and  i was very excited for this conversation 

watching this movie was not as enjoyable as thinking about the question but it was still a blast 

this is the hallmark movie of racing movies 

some of the action scenes were a lot of fun but oh my god this dripped so much of 2001 and um  i thought some of the body language froms ome of our actors were solid 

you could just tell that the uh  dialogue was just slwoing us down and

i wish i would have saved the video game reference  sorry i spill

cgi was worst thing i saw in my life 

1 distressed cowboy
frisbee golf conversation 

okay yes  i agree with a lot of said sataments  when i got hinto this movie we jumped into the deep end of action movie 

then what the fuck is happening movie 

then it kinda leveled out and i was okay cool  we are just in the shit storm 

mainly the dmx internet bubble moment  i thought this was oddly a very black positive film 

dmx is a self made man  tk owns his own club  partner has wife kid thing 

also defund the fuckin police film  we got corrupt cops  dmx trying to reveal that in 2001  right around 9 11 before all cops must be positive 

but then  we have the character that ruins this whole goddamn movie because he is  i will break all rules to do whatever because i m a white man 

but then i thought that steve segall just represents conservative american trumpism  this is the united states  left vs right  if we can work together like steve segall and dmx  maybe united states of america is great 

we can work togehter and meet libertarian crazy people in the middle 

this movie had a lot of problems but holy shit i had a lot of fun 

3 heron shurtz 
hakes pick of jackass 0 was an interesting choice for movie club 

i just had like a… so watching this movie very uncomfortable and not an enjoyable watch 

having this conversation about that movie has been a nice little um… uh  reinforcement of why i am trying to open an art house cinema in general 

the idea you can watch literally anything  and as long as you can talk about it with friends it can make anything watching worthwhile

it was pretty cool watchign and talking about it  you know if you can enjoy with people  i think we saw john waters having a blast on screen with his pevert friends 

this movie was not made by john waters to rate it all  so its a very tough rate  so    im just going to go   going to give it a 2 dancing buttholes 

and that is my review 

how do you rate something thats not supposed to be rated 

its weird 
similarities with the beginning  leaving town  got a cat  had the island installed to day  had to make six hours to shoot something for the second day in the row 

im gonna get this brown sugar 

i click play  i watched like 15 minutes  okay    go do somethin  email somethin  30 minutes  do this thing 

as i kept going  more and more stuff to write down 

the minute the movie got down    i started capturing scenes for the jupies  the songs  great vibe 

like man    this is what movie club night needed for this pick 

weve done some great stuff  exit wounds  pink flamingoes    this was needed 

we broke it down in chrono  just laughing about all those scenes 

this is what movie club needed

i lvoed this conversation  this movie was 4 patriotic topless um torture multiracial martrorcylce peeple tittes 
ok  im gonna go 

i was gonna tell a story 

so i totally forgot in highschool we just got our 16 year old birthday  so ryan thrower  josh grabner and myself was like  dude you want to go to indianapolis  i was like  sure 

got to the mall  got an anty anns pretzel  drove our asses home 

so this movie had a lot of that energy where you have nothing to do but go to malls  that s my relationship with malls 

so the movie  ive only seen this movie once  so this was the second time 

i was like ok we gonna see a lot of problematic stuff  it did a good job of setting up problematic stuff and then negating it with a joke or dodging it 

kevin smth did a good job there  loved that 

i think this movie would this movie been better wth a less budget  if he didnt have success from clerks  chilled out  the dichotomy of the independentness of this with lack of acting but with higher budget swings were an issue for me 

i think there oculd have been a really great tonal movie if the budget was a little lower if that makes sense 

on top of the ending  the both characters do not deserve the ending that they got 

those were my two beefs 

lots of strong female characters which was awesome

end of day i gotta give 3 chocolate covered stink palms post preztel 
sunday i hosted my buddy dustin and his coworkers and friends for his movie club  and they do something what we do and they do what we do 

they do hyper extreme  like only criterion collection  we watched hyper intense movie on a sunday afternoon  the coversation with them was good 

then to sit down and watch this  was just such a breath of fresh air  you guys pickin movies like this  so i just came at this lovin this cause i just need it 

just talking with you guys  pullin clips for the jupies  this felt like a long form snl sketch  agree that warren beatty was not the right choice for this movie 

i wish charles groden did more stuff cause i love that dude 

i just loved the whole goddamn thing  there s only 1 score to give this thing  but its my movie so im going to give it the same score but times two babyy  given it a 4 
i can add to this 

most sci fi movies are made so we can creatively um  use metaphors to apply to our real life  so i thought that this was gonna do  with bad action and bad premise 

but then it just went off… no use of metaphors at all  no creativity  but i do agree with sam because the first half of th emovie its just a bad sci fi  but theres stuff that could have grown into soemthing 

but it iddnt 

the battlefield was not on earth  but it was inside my mind  so im going to give it 1 psychlo genocider
forrest whitaker did these girls bad 

holly  thank you for bringing this movie into my life 

i feel like… i was critical of this movie in the fact of how it portrayed 

conversations  hang movies  i love hang movies 

im like this movie isnt doing it right  this is forrest whitaker 

i felt about  this film came out in  95  we are portraying complicated female black characters on screen  and how beautiful this had been 

like we are all a bunch of white dude  like all the social construct theres so many complicated black female characters  but at the time  what else was there 

so watching it at the time  this is the first time we are seeing all black women interacting  really cool 

you give this film a different director 

the sky s the limit  give it to a black female director 

gonna give this a 3 enduring friendships   

no matter what movie gets thrown  the conversation can be better than itself 

when uh  rachel was my guest pick  she mentioned this movie  predestination 

so going into it  the way she talked about it i had some history with it 

she talked about how its some kind of fucked up movie  and you shake your head 

in watching it  i was kinda sucked in  and when i found out that ethan hawk was in it  i had some faith 

i think he was able to bring you into this low budget sci fi  if you take him out of this movie it could easily go off the rails  but because his performance is so good he brings you into this low budget movie 

i totally love low budget sci fi movies  which it does 

theres some cheap aspects like shooting in the 1950s and everything 

wel all talked about it  loved simplicity but hated the terrorist bomber wipe solve something super simple becuase of this it kept it in this loop 

this movie is a paradox in itself  this movie is itself  this movie is the same  in that aspect it is 3 flaming faces 
ok  obviously this has been a busy week getting ready to host all ya ll    nites spread this  it was aa funny figuring out the schedule for our cinema and also finding the joy in the opposite side of the movies  these movies are valuable in a totally different way  the guys voices are terrible and maybe thats the point  i wish they would have edited more of the cuts  rewatching it i can t be too positive or 2 negative  so 3 tbds 

first off does anyone have neezer s number 

i work with michael neezers number  i want to be like   yo  

russian movie 

i did not know what we were getting into when i first pressed play 

it was super jarring  did not know what was going on  agree with sam 

i felt like i was out of the loop  and hake put it in wonderful context  we watch a lot of art house movies that are programmed in the us for a reason 

they are slower  westernized  it was nice to watch a 1960s film that s not high art but mainstream 

it was tough to follow  because i felt like i was missing a lot of stuff  made for niche audience that was russia  not us 

my biggest critique was that they did not let anything breathe  maybe thats western critique  then someone would commandere that and maybe that s ametaphore for the soviet gubmit 

there are some great scenes throughout this film  hard to stick with it  still enjoyed the watch  love how i have context now for this film  gonna have to give it dos robes with pearl buttons 
shag  as the probably non most non superhero person here in this group  i am at least very  i ve seen every batman movie now minus the justice league stuff  this was something i was familiar with  it was super refreshing watching batman in an animated situation  i got to rewire my brain  i got to go back to where it started with comics and watch the comic come alive  i think its portrayal of greif is why it s touted so strongly  he tried to have a normal life but his geif stopped not only his but his partners life  it was a multidemensional multifacited way  i enjoyed it  was it perfect no  but 4 bat boomarangs  in honor of reif 

ill go 

i was  so i was raised on musicals  like the music man who played toddy  his like  probably most famous performance 

when he entered the movie  his voice brought back my childhood watchin movies with my mom and sisters  loved the early vibe 

but 

the energy was just    i was not jiving so much with the energy  i was excited to watch an  82 movie  but it was doing a reflection of famous musicals in the 50s and 60s 

its content was so groundbreaking in a lot of ways  it was incredible how deep in the movie with no problematic moments 

elevating the gay community in france  elevating these characters in the 80s just blowin my mind 

sorry reif  do you think that they were hiding behind the veil of france  oh they are french  the one guy from chicago is like  they are hiding behind this french bullshit 

we can make thsi movie thats progressive that s french bullshit  bullshit 

the whole end is like we are gonna build the people up just to knock them down  men need to be men  women need to be women  the gay people can be french weirdos 

im like what the  they build it up and then  im at a weird crossroads with this movie  even 80s so 3 norma s small rages 
riding the jordan wave 

i was really excited to watch this because my coworkers were specifically talking about this movie two weeks or a week before megan brought this 

i don’t knoww hat the fuck they were talking about 

didn’t know it was a mockumentary  watching it in 1999 i was blown away with how it predated how everything we watch now is in the mockumentary vein 

they are fake and use the medium that is very funny

predated a lot of funny stuff  joke after joke after joke 

so happy this movie is in my brain for references and jokes  cause its so damn funny 

if you take away anorexic girl  mentally handicapped brother and a little bit of the peodofile  you get the perfect movie that beats up midwestern beauty queen culture 

with that critique i gotta give this 4 melted beercan hands 
okay  excited for guest season was great  we saw a lot of fantastic movies that we never would have scene 

it was poetic that the last movie was jeremiah because it’s the perfect reset everything and when jeremiah picked im like why do i know this movie 

i emailed the director of this movie back in the day  cause dusty wanted to see this movie  you could email the guy and get a screening  but he never answered because the website was too old 

public house cinema and i have to agree from sams first comment  the minute this movie started im like  this is so jeremiah its david lynch low budget musical 

the music  feeling  i was exactly in the mood for this movie  i really appreciated that it knew what it was trying to be  just a weird bizarre movie  the minute it went to being a dive bar in the solar system i never really got off the train 

theres some problems about it for sure but it knows about them so its good  this is easily a true 3 5  in the context of how much i enjoyed them  4 cigarrettes
didn’t know what i was getting into wit hthis movie  other than snoop dogg and a horror movie 

when it started  it was like turning on a lifetime movie  ut yet   it had a lot of wonderful things to say  ushc as gentrification  race identity  family    but it was a slog for like the first hour of this 90 minute movie 

i literally paused it to go pee  and tehre were 30 minutes left  right before bill walked into the room to find maurice dead  and then bones manifested himself 

and then we wtached a new movie  that movie was snoop dogg running around killing a bunch of people  holding heads for comic releif  and rachel and i were like    this movie rocks 

in this movie there is a beautiful 4 star film that is the last 30 minutes  there is also a terrible 2 star lifetime movie in the first 60 minutes  but at the end of the day its a 3 spooky maggotrainhouse 
i had no idea what the hell i was getting into  since this movie has 18 names  but i realized that i came into this session warmer to this movie than everyone here minus the pople that reviewed 

i was like pretty much enjoyed the movie 

i think ive realized im totally seduced by 70s filmmaking  like i am all in  the grit the shittiness of it  the sound track 

the storyline was secodary and i didnt really care  the experience of the zombie movie and the soundtrack and the gore 

i realized i didnt need plot to enjoy a movie 

i dont have any history like really enjoying a zombie movie  so i dont have any backlog of analyzing it against other zombie movies 

i enjoyed a lot of the feedback  i let the movie wash over me  the critical eye gave me good insight 

end of the day i am very very seduced by 70s filmmaking and the sound track so 3 tits out scuba divers 
ill go 

so there s some bad movies that age well  because you remember all these fun parts 

and then there s some bad movies that don’t  i got done with this movie and i was like… yeah its kinda fun 

but then with this conversation i was like  wait  this movie is bad  anyways  my favorite part was dennis miller acting alongside dennis miller the reverend and then dennis miller the little person 

all playing the same person 

its been a minute since ive given a movie this  lets give it 1 skin express to tuna town 
i m still struggling with my score 

i remember watching this with a packed theatre and it was really special  to watch it with this many people 

try to watch it wash over me  but the minute it ended i knew i wanted to rewatch it 

what we just watched  the uncomfortability  wanted to revisit it  and knowning a lot more context  how this was made and the director going through a divorce and all that stuff 

i was just watching this as the first time i watched it for me the cinematography was a 5 of 5  the camera movements was just incredible 

i wanted to watch to absorb the rest of the acting  as a person who was married and has had someone come home and say that they are no longer physically with you and have moved on  this movie makes sense 

this movie was made by an alien  but that s what makes it good 

this makes total sense  he was just  he was having an exorcism of what he was feeling through this movie 

its kind of a miracle that this movie exists  its insane  it should not have been made  its just insane 

we are just gonna go with a 5 feathers 
so  i uh  did this week has been very busy  and  i could only watch this movie today and thought this was gonna be chill 

then i had to change the bulb out of the large projector in cinema 2 and that took all afternoon  so i watched the first 30 minutes at noon  and then i crammed the last bit right before the call  thats why the email was late  

watching a movie in that sporadic stressed out environment is tough  but this movie even through all that i was still sucked in and engaged through this movie  you could be 1 foot stuffed in and one foot mental state to pay attention 

the reason why i brought up the flaws was like we are all talkin bout it but we cant really beat it up too much 

yeah  is it a perfect movie  no but its damn near close to it  so i gotta give it 4 bitchly cow feeeds  corns  gosh i got it burned into my brain 
after whatcing black crhistmas athte can can and seeing how excited john carpenter kind of a movie made around the same time as halloween 

black christmas he brough into this so that i am a good twin peaks fan and fire walks fan david lynch restrained in tv is forced to be creepy in network tv so i was hoping for that  and we did 

carpenter with tv restrained was good lead performance in character and weird whacknoness made it go down smooth

its progressive for 78 in some aspects which is cool we talked about the plotholes so 3 almost grabbed shards of glass for me 
by winslow himself 

you guys have said so much i wish i could put some thoughtful new takes on this but i thikn you guys have said them and they are all valid 

i think everything about this movie when i picked it to hitting play  not knowing what i was getting into   the crazyiness of the film  its 70s sloppiness was heightened  i was just catching so much stuff like daft punk so much taken from this movie 

i guess ill keep this short like ryan not too favorable sat with him a while  i enjoyed the movie a lot today thinking about it  everything about this movie is just so god damn funny in hindsight  just so ridiculous 

i htink i gotta give it 4 beef 
this review is actually about citizen kane 

oh waow 

sam  this is the last episode of moobie club  reif deletes the excel sheet 

i was excited to review when hake picked an old film  havent seen too much orsen welles movies  ive seen a couple 

im not a orsen wells stan at all  i saw citzen kane  its okay  its a moobie 

i have 3 movies from the 40s that i lubbed  but orsen wells doesnt feel like the same energy or vibe that i like from that era 

don t love the stuff i ve seen  totally love and respect what he does 

innovates and changes how cinema works  which is incredibly cool 

as a moobie  we talked about the issues and the problems  people took the great parts and added onto it to influence movies  and you cant take that away from future generations 

peronsally it was a 3 sweaty excitable hyper close up grizbees 

am i talking quietly 

what can i say about bug movie  i was excited to watch a david cronenburg movie fro sure  i have convo with artist and he loved this movie  he said   i cant explain it  i dig william s burroughs 

if you are into william and movie  i learned about cronenburg  this is impressive it exists and toes line  sadly im not in world lunch or burroughs 

we dont do half sips here  for me it s totally a 3 and half sip film  lean back in movie club fashion 3 sips of cronenburg juice 


i went to this movie with no expestacions and its th ebest way 

this movie is the blast  i don’t know what yall talkin bout the minute this movie edited in a way it geve it depeth

had nuance for this age  whole point was trap you in 1 way of story telling and then pull back like mlm like white guy is racist but actually society is racist 

expectations   shitty

actual   enjoyed

yeah im gonna age well as a fun movie 

so go movie  4 crunchy herbal rave shits next 

i didnt eat popcorn for a literal decade after i saw next  
this conversation was good cause i expect this film to be a certain way with mixed emotions watching it 

things have been tired  taking care of dog and sleep deprivation and talking about stuff watever same boat 

i will use this review to like discuss so heres how my day went  thank you all for being here 

my car is stuck inna mud 

cant drive my car outa parking spot  sposed to go with dog and rachel to vet but had to drive bmw to do tax meetings with lizzes mom and got outta there and came back to can can for projectors and it was raining all day

all tops were pooling water  take it home didnt work and mud hands  shovel home and riders of justice 

spigot to wash hands and water no come and then water running outside of the siding of the house

rachel is outside watching and im walking kimchee and then i run inside and busted pipe in our basement  water everywhere and water shutoff is panic mode

i was told where water is  i find it  shut it off  water everywhere in basement

im going to go back to work now so i drove to work and got that done 

3 chubbies

dang shag 
piggyback   i picked this movie exactly why hake said it  he said he would not normally watch this movie 

something i normally wouldn’t do  and watch with friends  i was bummed out this was our movie pick  this was way more than noah than i thought it would be 

i thought it would be funny or going for something cause of the clout in the cinema universe 

i was like  this is just a movie 

i still enjoyed  like at the time it came out in the 1987 and romcom not gettin together  not aged as well as it shoulda  it wasnt hot takin everything 

better version of this movie exist now 

i was just at tik tock with some poeple and we conversed about midwest vs east coast vs big cities  these are all people who we dont relate to cause they are in arrested development 

big city movie  prioritize their carreer  friedns with coworkers  people in big cities dont understand and arrest development and carreers and critics love it cause these characters exist in their world 

for us it doesnt really make sense in our life  coming from that angle the movie really does make sense coming from a midwestern perspective  feels vanilla  movie gets vanilla score   3 screwdrivers from concentrate 
i don’t have too much to add  i feel like joe dante really loved b horror movies  with the humor and care went into mant 

wish he woulda given more into start off with family friendly  1960s kinda vibe 

but then to turn on it and go satire at the end 

it didnt do that  i think it coulda gone into really good category  feel like a lot of you guys  right in th emiddle with my 3 shopping cart uncles 
im happy you chose this movie cause i needed an excuse to choose this movie 

i watched two of this mivoes first one at the can can  this was a masterpiece so excited to see it 

knew the financial baggage and agreed with what everyone had to say with slow pace dichotmized falling asleep and incredible restaurant scene 

i have to agree with people this is a masterpiece in its own right  no other movie visually doing this  but to give it a masterpiece for me it needs a narrative  in hindsight i have to give it a 4 crown brands as entry into recursive clubs 
ryan has seen the movie twice 

all of us have seen it once 

we talked a lot about this movie  has manic pixie dream girl problems  i don’t like that its called  something wild  but then show s black america in the background 

feels weird viewed with that lense  take that away and i fucking loved this movie so much 

had the feelies in it  i loved the first half  just a hang 

fleeting moments of being wreckless  joy of not worry about it was captured and really really lubbed it 

if it landed on feet and he didnt get the girl and in his pattern shirt and pattern tie to kind of realize  but then it didnt do it so it just kinda    i still loved it so 4 virginias for lubber t shirts 
i was listen to the reviews even if muted 

i had to clean up theatre 2 after our 420 film 

i think i would echo a lot of people  the movie was a lot of fun to write down 1 liners  once it got it s sentimental ending its not gonna be as fun to talkabout  this very ridiculous conversation i was slightly participate in but mostly listen to the podcast 

made me realize this movie has unforgivable moments  i was gonna give it 2 but i think it feels like 1 cgi boob

jordan  or titty cup

suction cupped against a glass pane 

gotta get this movie outta my rear view  i really don’t like mike meyers at all  i think mike meyers is trash 

he does a good job at shrek  and austin powers 

i remember rachel was on her phone scrolling through the whole movie 

can someone get mad with me about what is happening with mike meyers on screen 

this conversation has been really good  context of his whole situation 

i think there was a lot of fun aspects with the cop all the stuff we talked about 

even the female characters both were enjoyable  did not enjoy his beatnick performance 

have to give this 5 woman and  3 whoa man   2 units 

im gonna say this conversation has been really good  when this movie ended i really enjoyed my experience 

i was worried that i broadcast newsd it again  like decent movie but boring conversation 

i was nervous  picking a movie not good movie to talk about  but i really enjoye dour time this evening 

i think the biggest takeaway from this movie we allknow there s like  a 5 star movie in here the ingredients  storyline  premise  julia roberts  the bones are awaesome but it kinda fails probably because the company that produced it disney and year it was made 

end of day super breezy and super oddly enjoyable for how many problems it has 

world acknowledges problems and this movie needs a remake real bad 

take the premise and make pretty woman again it could be amazing 

thats my take rachel and i both liked this movie  loved lack of conflict  gonna give this a very very high 3 steaming polo divits 
keeps the train rollin

this my second audry hepburn movie shes sooo good in bfast with tiffany she capitvates you as you know in this movie 

was excited happy we did it but we didn’t talk about it this movie is a frasier episode  2 people lying and thinking they gettin by with it but both are lying and comedic but instead its beautifully sad like life 

this movie works cause the ending but because they arent together this beautiful moment in time and we can all relate to that so many iconic scenes lets smash guitars over peolpes heads  this coulda been near perfect if it wasnt greggy peckky but with 2022 lense we needy more authenticyt and too much hollywood he brungt 

4 truthy hands inside zombie     monster     gods mouth

jordan  hey  jesus was a zombie 
at this point in this call its just like yeah echo a lot of fhwats been said  thank you ryan for making this movie  fact ive never heard of this movie is crazy 

the mixed feelings makes sense  but so many scenes that etched in my brain 

loved this movie and crazy swings  it had that 2005 masked and anonymous energy  we all graduated highschool around that time 

this is just a weird year for art and film  this movie captured that weird moment 

the movie ends on a bummer and also the sexual undertones like overt  there is a lot of it that is cool but then a lot of creepy shit  but then knowing john tutorro was woody allen friend but gross blast watching it 

gotta do hake hot take and give it a 3 cucumbers in gardners ass 
okay 

okay babyee 

summed up what i was feeling  basically if you combined sams review plus hakes interview  my headspace i was not really in the mood to watch anything on the longest day of the year and be inside  but its movie club  lets do it 

couldant get in vibe and i agree with hake rachel has a close friends and she wa slike what the fuck this has nothing to do with what the community is all about  does this movie get a pass or get some 2002 stuff or because its like shining a light on this group of people 

hake  there was also female reviewers and this is wild 

shaggy  is cause they shining light on this and thus doing it correctly  i had a lot of conflicting thoughts  the spanking and masturbation scene on her made me feel real bad and   

the movie came into did not like way came out i dont feel anything about this movie i dont feel good i dont feel bad  its just a movie  wish could give 2 5  but it s a 3  most positive review over here because i feel nothing 
you guys don’t understand 

just roll with it 

you guys know my black hole that is superhero stuff  minus batman  penny hardaway baby  basketball 

i didn’t know this was crazy the nazi thing broke my brain  it had that indiana jones vibe of that era  i did enjoy the twist like  omg he would be a nazi 

get thrown that as an adult  at the beginning i was like    oh no  this movie gonna be a thing 

then alan arken tho  hes a gonna be a rea guy  happening good time 

grithif obserbatory  the mobs like okay you nazi  we agree on fbi  mob we hate the nazis 

that part was very very funny  will always make me laugh  that s one thing america can agree upon  nazis  they suck 

sorry guys in and out big event  down a director 

the one thing i think i took away from this conversation takeaway twist the story around you got a killer killer movie 

lets remake the movie 

lets get that llc 

baby

maybe the animated series reworked the script 

live action little adults 

timothee chalamander as the rocketteer  flying slither boy 

i had a good time  issues with it obviously  will remember fondly 

not kcik it up too high three silgces of prebem goes to alpuculpomerica 

prebem chews gum on a long log 
thyme traveler 

export something  i will not export the video now  exporting the preshow 

that’s why i texted you guys  canopy is a national thing connected to the libraries  it s just wheather your library is a party of it  you sign in going  here s my name and here s my library  and like yeah  review this movie 

second time  second movie club  we watched this movie  i remember the first half of the movie and the low budgetness of this movie and its goign for things  um  i forgot everything iwas going to say 

end of story concept of the movie is a good idea it was written so poorly directed and executed poorly  it s gut reaction of the film was in a good place  it didn t really land a couple of things coulda gone in more interesting places  i cant believe ive watched this movie twice like a lotta you guys 

movie i watch niles crane frasier bit convesation we were on a clip we would go off the rails and talk for a topic and go ten minutes its been not like the movie we avoid talkin bout actually movie the heart was in ag ood place so 2 cheeky lil mystery boxes  it tried  

jordan  it tried really hard  added another idea 
i have a comment to piggyback 

while watchin this movie  i was like oh yeah this is ryans pick  ryans pick got a vibe 

matinee  romance and cigs  misery 

had a vibe  wait  i don’t think ryan picked this one  out of this movie i felt a ryan s movie from this and then we heard all that from ryan 

this movie was  obviously we had issues where it didnt go  it kept our attention the whole time 

like whats the next bit  next joke  had a big issue with the female character  just get rid of her as a person woulda worked  keep as coworker 

i think this ages well and our 2022 lense chips away at this too much  had we grown up with it we woulda loved it more  cant fault love 3 copies one for each toilet  and one other copy for the bedroom of 100 girls id like to pork 
clears throat 

this is the first movie that i picked for movie club with a pure gut  saw this movie and don’t know anything bout it and just want to watch it 

the ironic part this has been some of the most fun ive had randomly throwing up a movie 

it was really fun for everything we said  maybe its talked about more  but i just didnt really know of it  charles grodin s performance is incredible 

one thing that was one of the funniest bits was the through line with mosely with deniro  just chasing him and the cat n mouse with the mob and fbi 

loved all of it  so close to a perfect movie  but it went on maybe 15 mins too long  it hits a peak in the desert  all the cop cars come along  and like shit theres 35 minutes left 

thats when the fbi stuff happens  and gets a bit long  so close to perfection  so close 

but holy shit  charles grodin the man  gotta go with 4 cause it smells perfection  4 non counterfeit counterfeit 20s 
add that hyphen 

i was editing and pulling a reif and editing a video and listting and deep into masking out a hand it was super cool 

it was super cool just listening to you guys talk about this movie that you guys really really enjoyed watching 

this was awesome conversation about this movie i just watched 

i had zero expectations  no expectations  only jon woo movie i seen was mission impossible 2 faceofffaceofffaceoff thank you hake for laughing at my joke 

this movie came in super hot  i dont know what to think about it and it got more and more interesting with the plot and trying to keep up with it  it was a perfect movie club movie and i really enjoyed how ridiculous it was in the beginning to how level it got in the end and then crazy at the end barbell film im gonna think about this movie for a long time 

in movie club  history  this needs to be remembered  5 day saving little pisspot movie  give it a 5 

the pandemic we started this whole thing and we had to be special 

we are all so damn extroverted and movie night is a good time and those my thoughts on hakes review good 

we all said it and i think there was a fantastic  great movie that coulda been made with these bones 

the bones of this movie were really good and i think we all really noticed that  the problem is that it got in the wrong hands 

this movie feels like it was crafted around bits  like robin williams hands  and this concept  that s where all the sex scenes come in  this scene s funny right  let s just make it work 

like the jamie fox thing with the bra 

that s an snl thing  that s  the movie suffered from some attention grabbing thing sadly that 90 minute movie was 2 hours and everything extra was added onto it 

but

there s some performances in my brain  not mad that it s here 

ll cooljay for the win  this only gets 2 peas and carrots in a problematic white puke pile 
i am excited that we cracked open the first epic movie  and it was a big one for that 

i think the conversation was good because of the historical context you guys gave  happy you guys gave it was a little slog  loved music loved the costumes 

back half  not sure if pacing was off  cause of the mixed bag for me we gonna go with 3 turds in tha bowl 
sadly didn’t get to participate too much 

sad i missed this because it was a fun ride  my brain had no awareness of this movie  i also was not aware of rick moraniss s heavy canadian background 

i watched this with rachel  we were talking aftewards  it s like wayans world meets billy teds and take out beer and put in canada and you gotta movie 

i also think i really enjoyed watching a movie about dudes who loved beer so much  like this won t ever be doen again  two dudes obsessed with beer and drinking so much is awesome 

people who like drinking  people aren t going to find that funny anymore  it was kind of fun   like mainstream   these  guys drink beer and it s funny 

so yeah forgot a lot about the movie  but i think what i do remember i really had a lot of fun and so much fun they had with it 

thanks hake i will never forget hearing the story that you were watching this in a camper van so 3 x 2 minute pisses on the loony bin 
i will hop in 

i don’t have anythig smart to say about the movie at all 

hake i had the same experience  when we first jumped in i was like oooh nooo 

then we started getting into the story  and it was kinda entertaining 

at the end of the day we wanted it to be better  but the time period its a simple movie cause that time period 

that era was not very complicated with how we thought about things in art  at least in these corners of the world 

yeah i think we said everything  i dont have anything smart to say 

but holy shit taye diggsss face is the best thing to movie club in a while  this is two mr diggs s faces on a marble floor for myself 
hes got his baseball bat 

wonderboy

baseball is probably one of the most cinematic sports  that’s probably why i love it

it has pace  storylines naturally happen during the game  theres a lot of individual battles with batters 

this movie has always been on the watch list 

i think i talked about jordan off to the side 

i hope they do the sports side of it well at least the drama was enjoyable when they did have it 

and yes  it was majical realism with homeruns all the time 

issues i had with plotholes and it being a novel makes a ton of sense 

i was gonna say um  could not get over robert redfords age  can we cast someone looks closer to age 

but i really enoyed that and some of the secenes are gonna be in my brain  would love to see a cut where he strikes out and they do it like the book 4 poison little morsel tartlets 

happy we watched this movie cause i havent seen this version 

i told rachel  its ryans pick  he doesn’t know what he s thinking yet  and i was like   i bet hes gonna pick little shop of horrors  and she was like  no hes not gonna  

i knew he wasnt gonna pick batman returns 

and he picked it and i was like  i knew it 

i did not know what fully i was getting into it  it was a hard musical straight up 

this conversation was great 

i was trying to figure out reading between the lines i was thinking it was a critique on selling your soul   capitalizm  anything you gonna put your soul into was gonna destroy you if you let it get too far 

but yeah had a lot of fun and    yeah  we said all the good things 

so this is gonna be 4 glitter lilly funeral arrangements  1 more than the movie itself 
lets rock n roll 

i was blown away that like with johnson that noone else has really seen this or had a history of it 

i knew i had like blindspots in these john hughs movies  and this one made sense the minute it started 

they were cursin or whatever my parents would be like nah 

rachel was like oh this is a classic 

it felt like a holiday  movie  yes this is a christmas movie 

this was definnitely a christmas movie 

i enjoyed the writing of the film so much minus the nuances that we expect with our lense which is uncle buck s arc and niece tias arc 

that woulda kicked it in the upper echelon of movies 

the two little kids 

i wish we coulda hang out with this whole damn movie 

yeah  everything else we talked baout it and this classic is now in my brain 

to bring back death 

john hughs died at 59 walking in the street in new york on a trip  got a heart attack 

take care of yourself guys 

wasnt even in chicago 

is john hughes even still alive 

died in 2009 

anyways 

4 gnat circumcising hatchets 
office space came to me very late in sentimental season 

its poetic now that i have a cubical and work for an ad agency 

i love the world that office environment creates 

this movie  once he goes into hypnosis  theres a big critique in capitalism   socialism   goes full socialist in paying bills and live my life of boringness and dress in all grey which is what people thinkg socialiism is 

i think this movie held up minus the gay slang that was still around 

other than that im pumped to watch and relive this movie with you and im suprised on how much this movie made in my life  5 bobs on how much this movie affected me  5 bobs this movie affected me  all five of them love michael bolton 
 hops in 

i thought this was a very interesting pick  i think a lot of us went older in our scope 

i was going to go more adult sentimental  sounds like jordan did in the opposite but i love 

adulthood of his twenties 

i was excited to watch this  i think theres a really killer film in here  you cut the beginning a lil bit  and get more into the action and the relationship 

re make  hollywood movie  china  all that and they got a super great movie with a lot of heart and all the stuff we love about it 

and this is super poetic to end the 99th movie on this  and we started with bloodsport all those years ago  and then we got this from bloodsport to karate kid 

before we all break and come back 

gotta give this one 3 jackets up with attitude 
 background chatter about steamy hot loads 

mila kunis says  she knew her 2015 jupiter ascending would flop at the box office before it started  the luckiest girl alive actress spoke to blah blah blah blah blah quote   when did we know the movie would flop  when production got sliced in half  often times these things have a very good stry line but extraordinary other things  budget got cut and movie was different 

this movie coulda been a 5 but instead it was a one 
yeah  i like uh most of you guys have not ventured into bollywood  even though i know what you are getting into with bollywood  this is super hard to judge from this movie club dubble 

we are coming at it with our movie club lense  and that man  man last music scene next 10 seconds  next 10 seconds    there was no storyline advancement 

it was just we are doing a music video  you would erase the music videos and get the same thing  but i gess thats not the point of bollywood 

also did you have a hard time keeping up with the subtitles  this one was you were forced to stick with the whole thing  which is something we did not talk about 

i think this conversation was a blast and i agree with jordan i was like  johnson where is the google algorithm ai movies you are picking but yeah 

as a person who has had to screen indy films for film fest  this felt  i know 2004  this felt like something i would have watched from last year s film fest made for  10k 

mindblowing that this camera work was accepted  fun to watch in this context 

2 removed glasses  dhoom   every says dhooom 
i picked this movie for movie club because i didn’t wanted to watch it alone 

movie club is becoming movies i want to watch and dissect with your friends 

this made me realize why i picked for movie club 

i had higher expectations on certain elements story wise  and thats what i expected from night is short  and loved that vibe 

not exactly what i wanted from a glam rock opera  but i liked it a bit more after talkin about it more 

because of the source this makes sense that someone who doesnt identify as their birth gender  this movie easily could be picked up as that because i think the undertones are there  orientation  gender identity 

its a transformation story  and i think that its great 

i love how the director gets you in the weeds with japanse culter  you are so deep in the weeds with fuedal japan like what is going on 

and um  im stuck between a 4 and a 3  truly i slept through the whole thng  i wonder if its gonna age  3 from my experience i think the songs were a little long and felt 1 note when it was a queen pardoy  positve 3 cursed elongated arms 
ive always known that this movie existed because i never watched it because it looked so ridiculous 

super mario world is easily my favorite game of all time  probably the only game that im actually good at 

so i had a lot of exciting and patience going in knowing the lore and yeah everything  you guys are correct what we talked about 

but  once we got on board with not caring about anything i think i had a pretty good time  and overall i enjoyed this movie more than i did not enjoy this movie so this this 3 screamin martini worms 
dude the names in this movie were insane 

we already talked about it 

never heard of this movie  which is wild  i shoulda known about this going to blockbuster  or checking out at scotts and kroger in fort wayne  id be like mom can we get a movie 

it was always like rodney dangerfield or brave little toaster 

i cant believe this did not pop up on our radar 

this is wild 

it was the same vibe and watching this as an adult makes me want to rewatch all those movies 

the premise is insane 

wish radio
kids dinosuars
done 

noone proofed this 

noone was like  lets make this a little more interesting 

i dunno 

the internet wasnt really fully formed yet 

theres a part of this movie that is very valuable because of that  cant beat it up too much for the insane plot 

at the end of the day i couldnt figure out the vibe of this i couldnt fully sink my teeth into it  so im fully happy that i watch it  if you gonna give me 1 song out of the middle of nowhere feels a little pandering 

so    i agree with everything jordan said  but i am gonna give it 2 circuses with a notion of spice 


i ve seen this movie  coming off of fargo ive seen this movie before i was excited to watch it  i was not in a good headspace during pandemic but then by making me know not love this movie i had the same issues everyone had with it and went in with low expectations 

i think this movie requires your attention to bring back some of the conversation we had  i do love boring movies 

i like watching slow boring shit sometimes 

all the things hit  the bullets  the fans  all that kinda made sense 

at the end of the day  this is just an episode of frazier and noone knows how to talk to each other  and i think thats why i loved it  everything hit this time 

that top song at the end  i really love it and love seeing the roots where it came from 4 curtainless windows or hot glasses of milk that s been sitten there for 2 days 

jordan  thats not the fuckin measurement 
after hakes whiplash… broke this up into two nights  was excited to return to it 

didn’t even know about the movie  love ethan hawke  always a pleasure 

i brought it up lightly  a lot of our critiques are very valid  but a lot of them are as if this movie was made now 

whcih is very true movies dive into the right areas  at the same time this movie is super simple and its beautiful because of it s simplicity 

it was super refershing to see it be simple  you know we gonna bring up these topics but not explore them 

same thing im going to remember this very positively when i talk about it and the world  even thogh the movie is racist and white  that s just 90s problems 

i gotta lean positive  so this gets 4 chickenshits unmichaelphelps like swimmer boys 
 comingoff of gattaca sci fi i was like oh god thank god we don’t like making movies like this where they can just phone it in and its just funny cause its clint eastwood 

it was such a weird two er double edged sword  it was a hangout movie  which i liked that hanging out and floatin along 

so much casual violence and there just no conflict  i like no conflict if it has a purpose 

i dug the hangout in the honkey tonk bars in 70s la  i agree we should have clint eastwood someone else then we woulda been rollin 

really frustrated by it but we talked about all that  now that we are reviewing  i think i am going to regard the ending of the movie and the emotional craziness and he went on this chase and had to go back 

i wish they would have  with the boxing thing  i wish there was a payoff  there was a good movie in here happy in my brain  3 pissens spittens fartins and ass pickenz
