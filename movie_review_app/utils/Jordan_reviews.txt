i would give it 2 elephant guns 
fuck yah dude i ll take that shit all day 
i think that this movie was fine  its not a movie for me  its really funny  but is it sometimes trying to be too funny  theres super witty jokes but is it funny  kassen having time not making statements about anything  you get old white people  thats find you gotta be succesful have money  the score was insane  i was insane about no breaks between music  tom barringers mustaceh was offputting  2 dead kkcs

loved the concept  fact he even tried  i would watch any time this is th emost fascianting type of art and commedity me how shitty the world is how mundane i wanted it to do more  i really wanted that  exit through the gift shop  we created a monster and fooled everybody  fact that this movie was made at all  fact that movies like this being made  4 slaps
between 2 and 3… definitely ended this movie  well idid that right on check that off the box  cause gives us an outlet to just bullshit and discuss things even if not for us or aimed at us or find it enjoyable  round up to 3 dresses shot off maids
i did not enjoy this movie  i had a bummer time with it  i don’t know what this movie   sam was this sarcastic that you like movies  yes  i thought you were being genuine you piece of shit   whats the limit  how recent does a movie have to be  i guess i dont know i dont watch them  whats the year  mid 60s   cool with bond   i suppose  i have no nostalgia for it  this movie clearly did not give me a good foot in the door  did not enjoy anything about this movie  flynn is hilarious  its hard to watch a movie like this  yeah women s rights and shit  it just sucked i hated it  i enjoyed talking about it with you guys   1000
between 3 and 4 coming out  just be cause of the stuff we talked about  it was missing this or that from being one of the fantastic fucking story for kids and adults  missing a tweak here this and whatever  gonna give i less i was just initially mad at the relationship with the relatship with the little girl and aviator  fuck you man i still have an imagination  i can be a kid too  im a bean counter  i live in this world now i was resentful  for sure  this whimsical view  but like    talking to you guys abou tit  i like it um  you know the scene at th eend where they are tyring to sescape the business man planet and mr prince stomps puppet fox stomps on a foot  that warmed my dark cold soul  this movie trie dto do a little too much trying to do too many things greatly didnt do it great enough
first steven segall movie  sensed he wasn’t up to par with other action movies  it was bad  not always in like  agreat way  i twas just kind of bad  bad  bad  fun stuff in an action movie  dude that’s hilarous  trying something and not trying something and trying to get away with it  steven tobolowski wild cast  i think steven segall has something i dont know what it is he s just this insane monster there is this sense of commanding charm funniness to him  all that being said  im with sam its a three like bruce lee or betters for me 
i had a fuckin blast watchin this movie  i think this movies gonna suck dog shit  ed harris  i gotta watch it tomorrow  goddamnit that s still on my plate  i have to get that done  was kinda drading it   put
plenty of dum dum 2 3 john richmant 3 beans above the frank
i didn’t like this movie  i was made that i watched it  there werent any boobs  i don’t believe in giving movies less than 1 star  im giving this movie zero dimple pies
i agree with a lot of that shit  maybe its  hindsight looking 2020 lense wanting it to be a little more than it was  i was defintely watching it in that way and it didn’t even figure that out until maybe we were talking about it a little its carpenter its fucking carpenter hes going for something a little bit disspaointed exectued not mad about it strucgggling to get there im not going one way or the other i just dont think it was quite there i wanted it to be a more a littl emore like the thing halloween carpenter escape 3 pairs
ottally worthwile watching of 80s crazy sci fi
i also thought this was a pretty good movie  um  older horror suspensy 70s thrillery stuff i thought this was cool was def thinking of hereditary a lot just in like cerebrally type thing well ahead of its time  intrigued by that  the audio was insane  talking more about it made me like it more  not knowing what the italians were saying added to confusing and unsettlingness unease  thought religious aspect was going to be more  wanted more unsettling stuff  give me more  more direct horrory type  that one jump cut when she comes out and screams and it cuts to a phone ringing i dont remember there was an audio jump cut super jarring first 30 minutes didnt love thes core or soundtrack so lighthearted wanted it to be more darker wasnt enoguh payoff at the end  going diff directions  simple  maybe good maybe bad  totally worthwhile if you horror fan  3 licks of d sutherlands toopaaaazed mustache

the person who uh picks it goes last  i auh  enjoyed this movie  i watched it in two parts  i really enjoyed that first part i was like what the fuck is that movie  blanked out about sound guy this movie is fucking ridiculous  i just uh  looked past the dumb shit in this movie  serial killer lithgow chase i was like okay this is what this movie is now  then it flipped script at end  he doesnt save her  she dies  hes listening to her being murdered  chillin in the snow  it was just so dark  i dont think it earned all of that payoff but it was going in this hilaroius type of way once it went for gut punch iw as like oh fuck okay  credits  props  wassup  i donno  i     3  4  gonna say 3 screams  thassa good scream  goddamnit i wanted to do a 4

funky headspace  gotta get this movie in  thought efortless joyride but instead i hated it  it was more frustrating than i wanted because it didn’t make any good choices  this movie was lame  too much  what hake said i can see myself watching this tight movie again  its a pretty dont thinkabout it action movie  coulda made better choices but it wasnt as tight  decently well made fucking awesome actuion movime  nas is dad  credits song  nas and his dad  oldura  nasses lil daddy  but yea  i wanted it to be tighter but it was less tight and too bloated  sloggish  11 to 2  but it was action movie  3 tasty boys  middle of the road like a big ole bitch 

i cant see couldnt tell ya 
i ve been waiting to not be a complete piece of shit  i just wasn’t buying what it was trying to sell  i didn’t think th edark comedy was there  gore horror not enough  hated the villian  villian was miscast  mutliation of female body mysogeny is problem right its on you guys to like yeah its bad  show it normalize it  but we are saying its bad  you could make more effort  sound track ruined me  cant believe that i just fucking hated it so much  trying to put a time an dplace in this moviewe just a normal american family stars im gonna be nice 2 bloody stars of the hand  2 is enough for me  i dont really  i don t really care about the rating system 

sam  i just think it s funny that your words don t represent what you said 

jordan  but i like to be a nice guy 

jordan  we like to just shit on movies  but there are like movies    but  i will be more outspoken about the negative things i dont like  and then give it a two 
im trying to figure out what to say about this movie and i don’t know where to start 
i brought this movie to you guys because i liked it 
i didn’t take a risk  nope  i m gonna do something i have seen and i like  i think this movie  and maybe i like it more after this conversation  talking abou the sense of like    its swinging for something  its being earnest  but also falling on its face and its straight up bad at times 
its schlocky and the actors are like  like reggie is arguably bad at acting  thats a nice way of saying it  but you re rootin for him for whatever intangible reasons  you want him to succeed  bros  muckin up  of course tehres tune out moments  this is a great movie to throw on at a party  you get to see a quad shotgun 
weird little midgets running around 
weird guy throws girl across room 
body gore
not cgi
this is a fun fun watch  pretty easy four quad shotguns for me  this is not a 5  not a 5  not at all  above a three tho  three i dont have anything nice i dont have anything negative to say
uhh  i don’t have a lot to say about this movie  this movie is a delight  um  i love seeing a weird little glimpse into a subculture and its just an amazing treat that this subculture is championed and presidented by one fo th emost charasmatic and graciious and seemingly other than a few misstesp  im in the cult i fucking love arnold lou frigno was hilar  such a big baby boy  big bro lil bro to erybody arnold is a fuckin banger this is an eazy 4 types of people that are the types of dogs to bite back hook line and sinker 
i loved that dudes frosted tips and he said eat me 

after sam gives a banger of a rating i fucking loved this movie it was fantastic 

loved all the 90s shit  4 juicy fruits outta fishbowl  nice and simple  nice and clean 
is that good 

alright  so um yeah i was like yeah definitely like hake  some of you when i started this movie iw as like  i was like  oh god 

i don’t kno what it was i expected better performances a different aesthetic  something else  i still even after finishing the movie  

i dont know about that movie

i dont know
i just
i dunno

i went to bed that way  i legit just   

this movie fucking lived in my brain

i didnt sleep well alst night  i was eeing club kid looks

in my brain

the whole time

and today the whole day i deep dived the entire fucking thing 

i grew to love this movie more and more as this covnversation went on 

insane and interesting subject matter

not perfectly 

in somethings all that well
overall it really hits  enough of what you want from it at least what it is gving you 

so yeah  im with you guys

4
money
success
fame
glamours

shag  one thing
much like hake there for sure  this was just engrained in my childhood… 12 or 13 when this came out  that summer or whatever when it came out on vhs… probably watched it a dozen or more times  the mummy… those movies are always engrained in my brain  when atley goes to meet roman caletrie with his hand i dont know what that means  its really hard for me to look at it  some of that racial stuff is a problem  this is clearly written by a white man and white people were not consulting with black people  the script the plot a couple dozen times i will see this another dozen times before i die  this is just one of those movies i will not have a problem seeing it  i love the music  the soudntrack  its great  i dunno i  not gonna go 5 im gonna go 4 lazer cut poopy dog keys that i get myyyyyyy jollys off with  coulda gone 5 but well see 
i gotchu guy 

it didn’t scratch any of my itches  1 double malkovitch wig 
i was yeah i did  this movie  kinda blew my mind  i had to reevaluate what i understood of bond  at least old bond 

i thought everyone in this movie was way tooo old  average age was 56 years  they were coasting  uh  yeah its uh  yeah its a fun movie if you had like 8 hours and this was 2 hours and your kinda not paying attention but you kind of are  this could throw on the backround for the fun characters the win kid look that that stoopidassfuckinpinktie 

its whatever 

i was gonna give it 1 but maybe give it 2o just cause we turly dont understhat the movieabs 2 moonbuggywithplentyotoolefromjordan

uh  yeah 

i really really enjoyed this movie  i ve loved this movie for eyars 

we talked about many of the reasons why  it really solidified why  its the first kids sports movie to like do some of these things as far as the beats and while  it was the template for many kids movies that came not now but in the 80s was clearly biding on this sytle of movie as far as i am saying for the purposes of this speech  it completely subverts those 

its like no  im not gonna do the things they said they gonna do  no win  no super deep character growth or whatever 

this movie did something special 

the kid acting blew my fuckin mind 

the trailer for the newer version  its like watchin a fuckin like uh adam sandler movie  with a comedy gag where the kid get hit in th ehead  hit in the nuts  forever  waowhowowhwo  i dunno

it just really worked for me i liked the commentary of th eparents being a precurser to eau parents you see it on the yankees parents faces at the end of the game they could hav edone a lot more with this which is why i dont think it perfectly works they sell that they dont wanna just be kids too hes so pissed at his dad 

i think this movie did a lot of great shit i think i did a lot of shit th efirst time tweak fleshed a few things out wmakie it more rounded film i love this movie it gets a 4 cruds for me

i ended last season so ill start this one  start this trifecta of cannibals off 

i did not like this movie very much  um 
there was just like so many moments where i thought there was something cool happening  i wasn’t in the right headspace for a styel over substance movie  some of the long scenes were just boring me 

when i thought the plot was moving along i immediately had to look at a picture of elle fanning staring at a mirror for 5 minutes 

ill never watch this movie again 

after the conversation i realized it wasnt a complete waste of time  cosmo panthos mandy fuckin movie style stuff i think samson said something about him being the height of pretention hes making it so ambiguous he wants you to walk away with watever you want you cant ambiguous if youw ant to make it in th emovie you guys know about this shit more than i do  2 trifectas of cannibilizm 
similar boat i was pleasantly surprised about this movie i thought iwas getting something hammy and cheesy i like this era of comedy remind me of major leauge like americana like dim dnew doon  it was very nostalgiance i love 80s thye look like this racyness like uh like what r might be now but pg13inthe 80s theres problematic stuff but did not like theres no pint where i was like oh my good ooohhh goooodd

hes just so charismatic

when you let paul hogan be an australian guy it works but when doing written dialogue like um 

the girl was a smokeshow she was really working for me

the bathing suite hiking outfit gave me a boner

yeah it  its like  i would watch this movie again dont have a problem its not a perfect movie i would give it 3 5 if i could its on the 3 side of froths blownoffacouple 
um 

i didn’t really enjoy this movie very much as well  uh like sam said this was just not this was nott he show i was watching as a kidt hat ws subversive animation type of stuff 

like i brought up earlier  this was gen x s answer as far as this typ eof humor to this society it lives in 

our brains are more broken we went through more shit when we were kids 9 11 wars  this humor is just fucking boring  lame  need something more absurd  bonkers  thats my satire i enjoy at this time in my life 

i cant say how well this was received by kids in the 90s by kids our age or whatever 

soundrack rocked 

i think mike judge doesnt deserve a 3 star rating  which is by my standards just middle of the road so gonna give it a 2 lil ole spidermonkeys 
i would have looked at it differently if i was more familiar with the ip 

i was charmed by garrisson keeler doing his dry humor when they all getting ready all talkin past each other not getting the details of thes storyes  i was hyped 

th emor eit got on it got messier and i just kind of lost the thread a little bit  i get that its like a hang movie  for me it personally just didnt catch me just because i wasnt familiar with it um 

i just thoguht it was long or kind of boring at times  i was still very charmed by a lot of it i thought it was funny i liked all the actors in it 

i just didnt think it worked at times where it wanted to  i just couldnt quite do what i wanted it to 

i loved this conversation talking with you guys i wish i was more acquainted with it 

3 failed hand rolled cigarettes by the kevin kline 
um  i don’t think i really like western movies 

i don’t know  they were never part of my childhood  clint eastwood was but i dunno 

i don’t think ill likethem  i don’t think this is one of those badges that ill have on my cinephile jacket 

i think theres just     like   i get why these movies are looked upon and better movies came after it that were influenced by these things  lets just get to those movies  i dont want to write off all westerns because thats rude

this movie was just very messy  i didnt really get it it  4 coffins filled with machine guns but now filled with gold 

shag  i dont like westerns but 
shortcuts by changingth to d 

jupie for best review 

who knows 

johnson for neon demon performed by sams serious voice 

okay  um  watched this last night right after finishing the second hyperion book which is in some ways a similar thing  im glad i stopped and watched the bulk of it today 

i liked the experience but id idnt enjoy much of it other than the visuals

i didnt know the arc of this movie  wsa there any character growth for anyone 

the characters that are still around end up exactly like they are 

other than kenichi just wants to dance with robots 

they jsut destroyed a city and are in the exact same state 

i thought it looked cool i didnt think it played well after this conversation it played well 

gonna give it my least favorite rating  3 uncles who dont give a shit about their nephew 

sam  makes joe about 5 uncles 

yeah  um 

ieeee  thought this movie was great with the comedy stuff 

i was really taken into a great spot with the comedy especially with the bombachs self refrential and self deprecating stuf 
breaking 4th wall comedy like yeah dude i get it im a fuckin hipster makin this fuckin hipster movie im an asshole i get it 

like hes makin a movie about a bunch of fuckin white affluent people i dont give a shit about

sure i will give a shit about their problems

still didnt really like them  didnt need them  

to quote when lester talks to dashell at the end it was a littl long at end 3 petersessions with donovich
to poorly follow that up as breifly as possible 

yeah i uh  also forgot tim burton directed this movie so i think i kinda had him looming over my viewing of this the frist time  i havent seen this since i was a kid 
i don’t know what about this particular viewing   

i get it is supposed to be stupid  i just thought it was so fucking stupid 

maybe if it was a little more honed in it could have been a better more tightly packaged product  it was just kinda all over the fuckin place 

while it was funny i dont think it was a home run so yeah  give me time with those people jack nicolson this is 3 attacks by mars  3 upside down is m 
i don’t even know where to start with this  cause i  i agree that you know this is an art house what is the point to try and analyze this 

for the first 30 minutes of this moive i put my pen down im going to try and let this wash over me right 

once it got into the narrative    the tagline of th emovie is like    it starts halfway through the movie  theres the iceskater this person gonna be with with

im gonna try and start writing some shit downs o i can be productive like a good commy

it iddnt work for me in a lotta ways it was exploitative and a propoganda film in its own way maybe trying to combat prop

we need to be sexual awaking to get cum out of man to risk destruction of man kind

theres a man making this movie and yes he is writing for females but he is writing them 

he try to maket hem sound sexually free but he saying it for them

i write it too much instead of let the 70s flow through me like jack lee

analysis hat and not enjoy it because of that

1 sexy soccerballvibes

man i never saw this movie 

some reason i knew kris katan was big part of it 

watching it was just like am i thinking of idle hands or some other movie i didn’t understand why he was in this movie 

when it happened it was mangical

i went in with low exp
but then henry sellick and  attention to detail i was really enjoying

the humor aside the 90s mtv style edgy bonerjoke shit was obviously bad but henry sellik doing it all the stuff outside the real world was so amazing and slwo flord it and brendan frazier never act like monkeybone again

chris tan for prez 

4 organs of chris corpse

i was very excited to watch this movie  walways ben on my list  we misunderstood that the two movies were drastically distant 

the joy we were assuming we were gonna get from the gounrdswell was closer in line with the second movie 

however  i think there was some fun shit in here but overall not cohesive 

the turn at maybe it was jus tbecause this is when i paused it and watched the last 40 minutes today 

the turn shifted to crime  drug  drama  thing  i wa slike 

 im not enjoyint this nearly as much asi was tonight 

channing tatum was very charasmatic and fun but it would have been great to know the ogher guys  fluffy was not tight not good drug connect dj guy

but i want this movie to be like the first fast and the furious for the fast and furuoius franchise  we got the characters but the format of the movie or like the way they did this partcular movie is not really waht the cinematic universe becomes in the future 

lets turn these erotic dancers into crime fighters and have like 10 of these and channing is jordnaa brewster and letty is like in and out but we no we wanted blah we wanted fun friends in this world not like    man i gotta find the right way in who im gonna be 

i didnt like it but really tight in the future i liked it i mgonna give it 3 capfuls of ghb                             
i thought this movie was  so like i didn’t even know what this movie really really was  amd the taglines like  comedy  then watching im getting more serious vibe  but maybe just movie club critical lense syndrome 

i felt like there was a little too much to be in both ends of the spectrum  too serious so beautifully acted and overtones of the relationship drama its a serious movie  

but

its also theres the fun parts and comedyish and i think it would have been more enjoyable or like cohesive for me if it decidedd but not more dark or serious too much mirror type situioaton 

im conflicted i think this movie is a cool really cool concetp i dont know if it necessiarly sells all of it on great package so great watycing wasper ing sni  dance at  the end is fucking great 3 with a point in front ubba myne blood alcohol content 
ill try to be quick  talk about a lot of shit 

a babababab  i did a little pros and cons thing  stick to the pros cause already didt the cons 

pros  little robots  teamup with college really cool  low budget and kinda scary  they werent ever gonna be that scary and low budget not gonna jump 

noise that the cable made while unspooling  like a wratchet 

dean imperiooliman as an actor thought he was fantastic 

cool that it did dip its toes and shit 

the expo they go to with all the subeconomies built off these types of things  really real and really gotta get your gear  you can cable and get your cable on your kayak  that felt cool 

im always down for an original ish futureistic type of context shoestrignt budget  tons wrong with this movie  tons of exposition  the script was rough at some time  this director gonna get somethin big and then they get a chance to do something crazy 

hopefully he wont write it  but i still rather enjoyed this movie im gonna give it 4 exceptionally inconsequenc out of place pillowfights
i don’t know 

i said pretty much a lot of shit that i wanted to say 

anything i say now is just purely subjective 

this movie put me a shitty mood  this first half i was like  what the fuck are we doing here guys  just gonna watch a buncha rape scenes that challenge us  

so i was just reeling like  thats not a tradition condemnation at all  i am gonna stay  but   

fuck i really did not enjoy it  the plot just needing to be moved on by perpetual violence against women or a created woman was just lazy  looked good  fuck this movie  1 nonconsentualvagianaplasty
sorcerer  i m going to go back and check to tapes to see if it should be called sorcers 

william fuckin freidkin  i said earlier shag  these shots remind me a lot of exorcist  oh yeah duh  its freidkin 

theres something about this movie i really enjoyed it  not i really enjoyed it but i definitely enjoyed 

the score  the fuckin tangerine dream score  do do do do dboodo lets use all the synths  lets do it 

i think we nitpicked a lot of this movie which is valid  a lot of this movie does not operate and i dunno it doesnt make sense  i dont really care  no exposition  zero conversations about anything you just gotta fuckin figure it out that dude at the beginning  one second in veracruz you gotta remember that guys mustache 

i was like whos this guy and why is he in town  whatever 

i think i love this movie becauase you just cant make this movie again  remind me of jodorowsky  almost apocolpse now 

it is that type of movie a mood movie a vibe movie   fully agree  where i was at  you are locked into these guys  gonna go up this jungle road  i was super excited when the phsycological movie so fuck it 4 drips of nitroglycerine 
i didn’t take any notes because i don’t know where my notebook is  which is kind of nice cause like just going in  rockin it  typed out some shit on my phone  i was in it this movie fuckin rocked  i said it earlier this movie like  someone put a dope ass 80s synthy score just underneath it and ill be in heaven its just all i need  um 

the sound effects were so crazy awesome like i said  the use of silence was really great and not taking me out ofit like some of these dubbed over voiced over audio added later movies do 

it was working on me  i didnt like the narration  the kid thing  these guys try and bring it to an american audience see soemthing great can make money in the western world but just dont  dont dont make athree year old sound like this fees fifteen thank you sam for awaking the showgun assassin wolf n cub world i choose 4 swords 
can i fucking speak my peace 

uh when i picked this movie i was definitely like  nervous  because i knew it was gonna be bad  i was just worried it was going to be so bad its not gonna be fun to talk about 

this has been a great conversation and this movie lends itself perfectly to one of thse convos 

its not a good movie 

its a master class in how to not do quality filmmaking 

but    its got that fuckin  thing  that i like  i was raised on this type of movie 

like  where was this movie 

its got that gone in 60 seconds  fast n furious  hammy and bad and bravado and earnestness and swinging for it but hitting zero pitches gettin lobbed at it it 

i love sly you look at the family tree with how much incest and how was who and who was cheated on and betrayed by them it doesnt matter because they are all fucking best friends at the end of this movie 

this is getting 3 distressed denim cowboy hats
ok i ll go  i ll go 

fuckin exit wounds  dude this movie sucked this movie was a bummer 

ive only seen like a few segall movies  this one being maybe the second or third after glimmer man 

ive seen some of his earlier stuff too 

this movie was like  fuckin  a mess  but i didnt really care  since i ddint really care   wassup belt shotgun strap shoot guy

random ass wire work for no reason jupmining over a fuckin tourist

this si the good garbage i want

segall looked bad with thin hari and curly hair he is on the way out  on the way down 

i dunno i feel bad for michale j wite

if eel bad for rip the greatest dmx  so he sucked but    it still looked dumb thing i would watch  um 

3 starchy heron shurts
i don’t have anything on my heart really 

yeah  this was an interesting watch for me and im glad we talked about some stuff that i was kinda figuring out  thanks for being my friends on that… this movie was fuckin funny  theres problematic shit  i dunno 

debating whether its art  good  bad    dont think theres a place where i can really weigh on  dont know if john waters was intending for it to be debated that way 

i dont think he intended for it to be rated 

i think history will probably regard this as either a zero star movie or a 5 star movie  but im gonna be a coward and give it 3 dancing buttholes 

 sips beer 
a lot of redundancies for the other boys who have spoken already 

more for me it was another case of this is a bit of blind spot for a genra for me  i know some blaxslpoitation ive seen but i assumed hits was a tougher hang than it ultimately ended up being

this was me judging a book by its cover  huh  

once you find out the nazis were the enemies  it takes a lot of pressure off me as an audience member its just like    good guys vs bad guys  this aspect of blaxsploitation they arent gonna talk about them bein black just goingt white guy treamtent 

impervious

head long into bullets

kill everyone in one shot

tornado and really fun

so yeah  the studnds wer grand and the the action was fuckin awesome loved the goldeneye ripped of tons of shit from this movie

and it had no musci where there shoulda been musci itw as fun 4 ptbts  patriotic bikeless torterures 
15 bucks lil man put that shit in my hand 

yeah so like  iiiii  weirdly i don’t remember all of it  ther ewas definitely a period wher emy family was watching kevin smith movies and i was too young for them 

i remember having to cover my eyes during chasing amy during family movie night experience 

jordan  cover your eyes 

crazy but cool in retrospect 

still really wild 

i was watching these movies when i was too young and they grew up with me and i was still watching them 

im probably th eonly one who has watched the reboot  and i still listen to him on a podcast  like not a superfan but he has nerd mind superhero shit 

well now he s not necessarily as funny  rewatching this movie i was nervous it was all a lie and i was nervous and but nope  it was funny  it really happened 

close to as good as i remember while being bad in certain parts  i was very  happy this turned out the way it did 

nothing crazy to say 

shit  4 chocolate covered sink palms 
try to be breif 

get my tie on 

puts tie on here 

i agree with what they all said  um  but also i like just  i thought this movie was very… loong 

while i wasn’t bored at times it felt redudant a lot  good bits letting go too many times before i was just tired of them 

free cast  blah blah blah  get more robot camels  smoke some camels  sing some songs  each of these guys get a hit record 

2 rogers n clarke hit recahds 

on a piece 
i ll go 

um  my rating system  a zero requires me to hate that i even   watched it  so 

with that being the basement  this movie  at least  i do not regret having seen this movie 

it is garbage  it sucks 

travolta is awesome 

im glad this movie exists  this is a one ker  one cyclo  one kerl 

kevin  you mean terl 

jordan  ker  i went with the black guy 

kevin  tight  he wins in the end

sam    they made me the head cyclo  cause im gonna win for eternity 

sam  she was like  swarthy  like italian 
harpers bout to clock in brah 

i don’t really have a whole lot to say or anything too well thought out at least… yeah coming into this movie   this was not a movie im going out of my way to watch   ive see a clip or two with holly

i don’t really watch i would consider this liek a chick flick  but really its a totally serviceable movie 

i enjoyed a lot of it  i thought it was really long  this conversation really helped me think of this really nicely  the way they discussed how they show you the spectrum of bad to good and all inbetween 

i was like  oh really there s slow growth happening for all these characters  yeah 

the complicated stuff with wesley snipes  complicated stuff with gloria allowing herself to be her own person  its not high end stuff you would see in rom coms or whatever  you know the grey stuff inbetween 

whoever created sex in the city  like thats that but with white people 

3 enduring friendships    thank you holly  thank you holly  thank you holly

sam  say my name

hake  call me big pappa

johnson  pappas comin

jordan  oooooooooooo
try to be breif 

um

i think at the core of this movie there is something very interesting  the paradox of the ouroborous 

adapting this story was a cool idea for a simple but small budget sci fi movie  even though i didn’t really like the staging of it with the opening conversation at the bar 

going down this path of this brain puzzle  the paradox  is cool and worthwile 

its something that is tough to do in film format 

i dont know what it woulda taken to be sold a little bit better  guessing the right thing each time  and then the fizzle bomber stuff was like   i dunno i dont really care about this 

i wasnt trying to get my red yarn to fill all the holes 

so totally worth watching movie didnt really blow me away  at the core it is an interesting story to tell 

gonna give it 3 fire flamy faces  fire faces  flaming faces

 rachel  its flaming faces


like shag said  i was dreading watching this  not like i was gonna be pissed  but there have been some movies i had 0 interest in watching  once it started it was delightfully stupid and i wrote down i don t know as much abba as i thought i did  i was delighted by some of the stuff  the abba songs  there was a song that reminded me of a song in climax  there was a song like da da da da da da dance shit  it sounded like  oh to be alive   there was a song that sounded like that  but  like  i dont know all that being said  musicals  i m more like rachael than anybody  some are fun if the choreography  but it was not a disappointing watch  i probably missed some of the nuance  but yea 2 tbds 

 overdoses on heroine 

okay here s my hotshot review  the diamond arm 

i thought it was uh  diamond hands the whole time  reif will think that’s funny

the diamond arm was a movie that i watched  and it went into my eyeballs  and mostly through my eyeballs  because i didnt hear th elanguage in its native way  because i dont speak it 

what i do speak  somewhat  is comedy  i have a subjective taste of comedy 

this brand of comedy is not necessarily to my subjective taste  with some of the slapstick stuff  maybe cause i missed some of them or naked gun satirical stuff  or any satire  um  is gonna require satire 

maybe i thought this was satire  but this maybe is more  funny movins  

and so for that   it just wasnt really hittin me 

i thought it got kinda redundant  like  so now they are gonna do this thing 

bash him on the head

get him drunk at dinner

beat him up in a bush

there was just some stuff it didnt get there for me  that said  its a cool peak behind the curtain of soviet russia  this is that type of movie that they would put out 

not necessarily propoganda  but more like a big banger comedy  it does have value to me  so i give it 1 robe with pearl buttons 
jujitsu is no joke  batman is a cool character that i like and think is fucking tight  and this is a good iteration of him  its a origin story you haven t seen a million times  a different love interest that you could see them melding weell otgether  usually they are toxix of a super villian or whatever  the animation is so different and awesome and iconic  yea  i don t know  it s not my favorit batman sotry ever but watching it i was like this is different and its definitely refreshing  i m looking forward to ryan saying this was the greatest batman to be a feature length movie  i give this 4 batarangs 

we will do 2 and 2  not to put the cart before the horse 

sam  car before horse 

jordan  har 

kevin  carhart on the horse 

jordan  horse is cold  needs protection 

first i would like to say that i took a bathroom break during johnson s review and i pisssed for 19 seconds  so thats cool

shaggy  i pissed for 25 seconds

jordan  i go often 

not trying to die of urinary tract infection 

sam  i should have taken a picture of my alien belly 

i gotta do it again just to show 

jordan 

okay   i also am a little inbetween on this movie  i dont love musicals already which stacks it against this movie personally 

i think this movie has a lot to do  thank you for bringing this  its cool and representation even if it is 82  its a cool reason to get representation of queer culture out there 

was it handled perrfectly no i dont think so 

club and a bunch of drag queens in the crowd and everyones having a good time    for that im like  thank you 

i didnt like garner  i didnt like the king marshawn  even though thats the point hes sposed to be bigot and comes aroudn in the end 

not saying this movie is supposed to be as progressive as now 

even when then said the f bomb twice i was like it could have been better 

thanks for movie i give it 3 normas small rages 
i don’t have a whole lot to say  i liked this movie  there s so much dated ass shit in here  i wasn’t really busy with trying to figure out how to let it work in my brain  i just let the stupidity wash over me 

clearly problems 

comedy is one of those things where you make swings and it might only work at the time and place  but definitly not working 22 years from then 

yeah its problematic but im gonna try to enjoy this movie 

mile a minute  joke every 20 seconds  gives christopher guess a run for his money with unheralded comedic performances and understated comedy with little effort 

i dont wantt o talk forever so i will give 4 melted beercan hands 
don’t have anythingt o super coounter that but i will go 

the american astronaut  like i said jeremiah showed me some of this shit and i wa slike  thas weird ill prolly never watch that movie 

now i have watched that movie  um  i dunno 

like we said earlier  this isnt one of those movies where you gotta like   really try to concisely figure out  its clearly a guy just being self indulgent doing his own thing not asking the audience a lot giving too much fo a shit i kinda just was having a decent time with it i took a break and watch the rest today 

somethin refreshing bout this movie forsure 

scenes will always be weird enoguh like timneric  not as you are laughing happening laugh your assoff so stayign power to this movie  so i dont call this a hot take butim gonna give this 4 cigarettes  was gonna give it 3  but i got spicey 
this is hakes bad  and that is now forever  hake bad uh hearing one of this good friends 

this is a bad movie  this is a great movie  this was  im so glad we all were like  ooh don’t know what the fuck that movie is gonna be  and then when i finally got to it was like   aw man  this is not as fun as i was hopin 

this is 2001 horror movie for sure  i have a lot of respect for the period piece for this type of moive  an intense undertaking  shots  wardrobes and all that 

you guys said everything i wann say  i thought it was pretty rough and good fun shit  worst blood ever  2 spooky maggot rain houses
good music and foley  bad acting  good blood  bad adr  good gore  violent gore  bad make up and prosthetics  i don’t undersatnd but it does make sense  

im with you guys on pretty much all of that  i also love that i watched most of this movie assuming that the dr was the reason for the zombie outbreak 

the fact that this movie confused me    i gotta give it props 

once i got the full awe shit this movie is a piece of shit i just started having fun  no fire 5 molotovs i was laughing my fucking ass off 

as poorly as i paid attention for the first minutes this movie was just 91 minutes 3 topless scubadivers from ya boy comin right in 
for being a theatrical release  this had such tv movie quality to it  and i think a lot of us just assumed that it was a tv movie cause it was on tv so much  yeah this movie sucked  this movie was bad  i don’t have a whole lot to say 

does line reading 

 jonas  jonas  

 honey  jonas doesn t work here  anymore    i retired him  

lillith definitely did that once 

sam   directs 

no but uh  whats her name angie everheart  im glad you got yours i hope you are doing well 

this gets two skin skin skin coasters express to tunatown 
before i start  i want to say this was the last page on this booklet 

goes back to  the little prince  from august 5th of 2020 

this movie  combing back from greenbay today  i was excited about hour 1 but hour 5 was gonna be a chore 

i threw it on  and immediately was like  this is a chore 

but i was not mad to be watching it  i was just  this is fuckin not at all going in a direction i want it to be doing 

i wasn t invested in the dialogue or what was going on which was good cause noone knows what was going on 

i did not like to know that she tried to commit suicide after that  like for what  this movie was not that tight so why 

i didn t really love it  but talking to you guys made it like a fun experience  theres some art house movies that i do for these movies but i do for this video night movie club was like a chore  i was like happy to do it but it was a chore 

so yeah  i dunno  that being said  i think im gonna fill i want to be hot and juicey give it a 1 but gonna give it a 2 trash feathers 
i really enjoyed this movie  which im sure noone else is gonna say during this review processs 

it went really quick and i was like  be 90 minutes  be 90 minutes  be 90 minutes  gimme somethin nice n tight 

but it just went down  it was over  very easy to do  so yeah  i really liked it 

had i not known that this was just such an iconic movie that i just never got around to seeing i just had to imagine if this was new to me it would have been fuckin mindblowing 

tight script  ahead of all the tricks  tight little package  super natural thing and kind of even stuff we pitched in this call  shes so fuckin crazy and wants his books and shes gonna fuckin make him hers 

blood gets a 2 from me cause of that coulda been a 5 but its gonna get 4 bitchly cow corns 
im gonna be really long and bruuuuuutal 

dude so like 11 weeks ago to this week  i demanded we do a halloween season  we aint done 

maybe we finish it next week i dunno maybe we talk after this review 

just thef act that it was something ive never ehard about theres an amount of gratefulness  plenty to be annoyed by 

theres defintely carpenter in there  i was kinda bored at times 

whatever 

weve all saide verything  im gonnag vie this its fairly benigned im gonna give it 3 almost grabbed shards of glass 
point counterpoint 

i don’t really wann talk that much 

i get this movie is being satiracle and a commentary on the state of the union at the time of the 70s musically  so much of this shit was fuzzy and half assed and not fully fleshed out… like hake said earlier one of his earlier films  not tryin to judge too much

not worth judging too much its like here s this fuckin thing we did 

but in the end  it really just felt like an inside joke that i was not a part of  so i just couldnt really get all around it  i dunno 

this conversation was definitely a lot better than    um    where my head was after watching and living with it for a day 

it was not for me  fuckin no  i dont like musicals  i dont like rock operas  whatever 

anyway i cede my time this is getting 2 beef 
the lady from shanghai 

i enjoyed watching this movie suprisingly  im the guy that is very outspoken about not enjoying older movies or just spending the time watching older movies 

but they are getting easier to   they are just movies  onceyou get to know them and interact with them  they are just like you  they are just moobies  not scary  just black and white 

so this movie was totally fine and super confusing  like for a movie with lots of voiceover and exposition  to not really follow super well was kinda funny to me 

the courtroom scene blew my fckin mind  courthouse scene gotta be watched on loop  truly ridiculous  everyone has 3 sweaty excitable grisbizbizzies 
i forgot mosta this movie already 

i was really excited to see another cronenburg movie cause he s an interesting director…  i guess 

hes iconic as fuck  but this movie was very bad 

there were parst where i was was like holy shit cronenburg but then i got bored in the last half 

but there was a couple two parts in there as well 

im here for croneburg  bugs are very funny to me 

and these were some bugs  and aliens 

3 sips of mugwump jhism 

this movie was bugs 

same path  tipped my gronola crunchy herbal rave shit

uh 

yeah it just was like  they were like   you know how they make good movies  lets do that  except not 

so i dunno  i knew it was gonna be a fun conversation  which it has been  cause this movie is just crazy 

but its just meandering and it doesnt know what its doing 

the idea of these 3 storylines coalesct and create but these kids are like fuck it we survive everything as gen x fuck you doesnt matter  maybe theres something cool

the gay stuff is cool maybe for being 1999 for a studio movie 

overall i was like blah  blahhhh

so half of what shag gave it 2 crunchy herbal rave shits  i dont think thats a good movie 
fuck okay 

here we go 

fuck okay 

so 

i had to work at 8 oclock this morning  i worked til noon at one clinic  i came home 

i had to finsih watching the last fifty minutes of this movie 

then i went to school  because my other school hada game tonite but didnt wanna movie it up but only 1 game even though freezy rain at 730 so practice ended at 130 and i came home at regular amount of time with holly

then we fell asleep reading words of radiance 

then i went to work  then i came home  then im here 

i got to leave and come home 3 times a day wich was nice 

that was my day and its a new thing we do 

i really liked this movie  this movie coulda been fucking amazing but instead it was less

i really like what ryan said about friends  regular action comedy like dopy friends but back story what you are led to believe series fucking shit i didnt get into but up a lvel for me coulda been great is not a homrun but fuckin interesting ass 4 chubby salamis 4
this conversation was fun  i was late  stressin to get here  took so long and fuckin annoyed cause it was a game i wasn’t told about  coach was a complete piece of shit 

got into a fight with my athletic director  so i stuck around to help with him  and it took forever to get here  i wanna get on this fuckin call and talk about this bland ass movie 

this movie is not my favorite  i dont think i wanna watch this movie ever again 

if i wanted to watch a movie about broadcast news i would watch something else  like the third season of the wire or like fuckin boston globe or whatever  news favorite one  journalism nightcrwaler truth warriors 

this is just barely dipping its toe in and i was just kinda bored 

i had fun talkin bout it  at the core  awe jeeze this is a movie about golly jee swell folks and sometimes they heckin cuss 

2  screwdrivers from concentrate 
i don’t hav e a whole cohesive thing point to make but when i paused this movie tonight at like an hour in  i found a documentary about nikolodeon  which was fine  but it reminded me of my childhood 

going through watching these shows  so much bad acting  i dunno  goin gfrom the movie to watching that was very weird 

also the beginning of the movie and his brother is hiding reminds me of doug and this movie comes through town and h  e was afraid to look at it and he takes all episode to work up the courage and sees the zipper on the back of the zipper and is like its a fuckin zipper costume  keeping his eyes closed  no point to make this movie was fine 

3 uncle shopping carts 
sam wants me to give this a 2 

sam   fuck 

dude  last night i was 2 city living in a 2 gay paris 

i was in a shitty down mood so this movie was not hittin it for me  mr magoo mr bean is not funny to me 

if im being honest to you i did not smile once while watching this movie 

you have to learn the language of this guys comedy before you can really appreciate it 

first understanding tim and eric its furnny the more you think about it then just in the moment experiencing it 

in the moment not enjoy but better time remembering the movie 

could watch again in a few years like oh this shits crazy 

ill agree about revering it for it s mastery  gotta go with experiencing it last night  but now im a 3 crown brands as entry passes to recursive clubs 
cosmo was passed out the whole night like a lil asshole 

get the fuck off this table bro 

didn’t hate this movie  i thought it at least like flew by  for a near 2 hour movie  which i think for a rom com   rom com esque movie should be pretty commendable 

we will get into it i guess  we gonna do like 2 of them  melanie griffin annoying with aesthetic which we got into 

took it down for me regardless of our ability to put that into a problematic box of movies made from a long time ago 

i didnt find enough full on problems with it ray liotas blah blah blah 3 virginias for lovers t shirts 

keepa da talkin 

i echo everything everyone said  ryan said lazy  i felt that  there was an attempt at a movie here  it wasa  bad attempt  i feel bad cause i was hoping it would be worth a good inspired conversation 

didn’t really do that kinda a stinker all around so that kinda sucks 

but whatever  i wasnted to havea shit season so goodlocuk to the resta youguys 

not tryinta woesime but i didnt get so much mysoginsitic and old jukes that were outta time and whole movie but on toppa that kinda find so you kinda just eugh all the time nothin earned and end up together at thend is so fuckin lazy and fuckin bullshit and bad writing 

would lova zero but hake said its not the worst experience points iever ever hand its gonna get 1 cgi flawless titty cup 



i really don’t have a lot to say  i feel like ive pretty much said everything 

big thing i thought it was gonna be him playin his dad  really enjoyed the dad character for the most part 

once you get setlled into it i wa slike this was not the worst thing 

this movie is bad

scottish is not my dad

mumble mumble

mike meyers fascinating motherfucker dude  this quizzicle deligthful career 

i dunno 

was not that enjoyable of a move  dude got his bajillions now so 1 woman  1 whoaaaa man   2 units 
i want to blend into the background and echo what hake says 

yeah this was a movie i don’t remember seeing a whole lot as a kid  but yeah  this is a banger of all bangers 

i don’t know how many times you know it beat for beat  but you know what s gonna happen  i was like  awe man there wasnt a world where they werent gonna end up together  which is fine  its gary marshall  he s paint by numbers  but good enough at it where you are like okay yeah it coulda been funny where s the com  too much rom 

but all in all  i think th emovie still works  you just cant like  squint at it too much  so 3 steaming polo betsy devots 
i agree with lotta shit 

this movie too long 

too long 

girl is asleep for first hour 

which is funny but then it goes on and on and on and on  sounds like tucker carlson cause of truth thing 

she does sleepy bit for too long  

aubrey hepburn is one note 

this movie could have been in color  that would have been good 

that would be a good touch  see rome in color 

gelatto 

let s go 

gimme that spice 

the last true thing i think  i dont  know a whole lot about old movies 

what genre of move is this 

it comes from an era of  there s only a handful of movies 

this is the genre of movie  it tries to have serious gregory peck crying and slapstick and action  and it s not all at the same time 

which is weird interesting quirck of movies like this  like it s the only thing made 

maybe it makes me get closer to old movies  but also not enough nuance for my fine tastes 

other movies perfected later  in different decades 

good convo  super bored during the movie 

yeah audrey hepburn whatever greggy monster hands in a mouth 3 


gotta rethink how i gonna use this  cucumbers in the gardners ass 

my review  this was a nice chat  abridged get to claim a lot of time on this call 

so i didn’t have to deal with johnson s bullshit  i could talk  i appreciate that 

could not decide if i fuckin loved it or fuckin hated it  i brought up fuckin uh  eh  masked and anonymous earlier  i dont even remember masked and anonymous    i dont know what tutorru was doin tellin people do go for it and it doesnt work    and it doesnt work cause it works  and oh this is a bad movie i just wish people saw cause its fuckin crazy 

gonna pretend last 30 minutes dont exist cause its fuckin shitty but furst hour 15 mins fuckin tight i dont like musicals where theres just 2 lines of dialogue  but those were bonkers part and greatest part 

tutorro made the first part on coke and the second part when he was sad 

if you think i love this movie  you must think im the cucumber in the gardners ass  this movie sucks  4 cucumbers in gardners s ass 
secretary 

not  the secretary 

shoulda been called  secretaries  

lotta spankin  lotta spanxin 

james spader  wish i was more familiar with your lusty side  instead i was just confused by you 

maggie gyllenhaal  really into it  could tell she was really into something 

got to do something a lot of other girls prolly went out for 

so yeah  interesting relationship to the bdsm scene that im not very familiar with  but kinda grossed me out    not grossed me out but grossed me out at times and i thought it was kinda boring and not very funny 

overall a miss  two hairbrush spanks in the bafroom 
this is not related to rocketeer  i played softball and they gave me gnarly ass blisters on my heels  i pray to god that i can walk and stuff on saturday 

i had to get better grip 

this movie man  this movie rocks  i thought this movie was gonna suck 

i mentoined earlier that i dont emrember this watched this early adulthood and revisited this and thought  aw man this not as cool as when iw as 5  and thought this was kinda a dud  a dud of a movie  this was anything but a dud 

clif seacord and this movie just fuckin awesome 

its like bad and when its goodbad  like kinda that vein i dont know how he did that kinda shit 

one annoying thing  in the fucking plot somewhere  it says  nazi  like dude  i dont remember that  the nazi reveal would be the most insane thing in the third act of this movie 

it is  but i read that it was nazi  so i knew that it was nazi all the time  that woulda blown my 5 year old mind it made sense the rara fuckin bullshit movie 

stakes remain stakes and win nationals and get abck to winning nationals  and all jennifer connely cares about winning nationals and this movie did not fuckin disappoint me at all 4 gum wrappers of pepsin gums chewing gum  what the fuck was it 

slicez of beamon chewing gum  1 shy of a full pack  i am chewing the 1 right now and i ahve 4 left  dont swallow it  alchohol jet fuel can run up against it for 70 minutes of the movie 
i have three thoughts in my brain 

i describe this to holly like what do you think of this film i can encapsulate one thing  i was like this is like this is where my brain went

if the characters in like the acting class cahracters in berry got to make a movie 

 hahahhaahahah by hake 

its super sloppy i wsih i coulda seen it first time for this movie knowing a few things david h pierce is bad hes doooin a thing thats pretty much all i memebred 

i mean man this is a really fun conversation and we tease out a funner idea and i realize this is not th emovie and ig ot really mad and sad and this is a movie that happened and im gonna give it 1 cheekly lil mystery box  thank you to hake for letting me making me feel happy allowed to do that 

hake   if you not speaking from your soul  why you are even here 

like what woulda you have done if i was like thank you johnson for giving me this movie   5 i would have lost if this was like so bad its skyrocket cause so unique yours was like thank you for bringing this movie because this is a garbage movie 

hake  i was like that was a bad movie  i forgot how much happened in the last half of the movie  and this was all based on the dinner party i thought this happened and i wa sinventing the movie that was better than it shoulda been 
talk about this movie jordan 

talk about it 

similar to shy little closer to sam said without the vitriol 

yeah i just uh  was very aw man  i don’t like this movie that sucks  i like danny devito  i wanna see more of his older stuff there s good shit back there i dont really care about billy kristil a whole lot theres miscast is one thing but then you got em and just fumbled them  i didnt have a good time watching it either i was like once you foudn out it was a zany filly rompt and the writing was  you cant get away with this whatever and you know to like have whats her name ann ramsey get nominated for ten minutes of screetntime was fuckin hilarious she had a long illustrious career from now this movie got her nomination 

so yeah no  no like  um ill will but i just like i was just like this movie is whatever 

2 copies of mr pinskies sluts i d pork on a copy tbable 
i liked this movie as well  this was good movie 

i almost picked it for my m season when we all did ms  i ended up going with i don’t remember  but glad we got around to this 

cause this movie is a template for good writing  good fuckin really well made movie 

there was aspects coming from a time now from now like they could like polish off like a coupla sharp ends in this movie but it s very effective for what it is and not asking too much of anyone  not asking too much of the audience its just heres a good thing enjoy 

a lot of cussing so fucking glad there just good not nuance cussing  just im gonna rip your fuckin head off ey im gonna rip your fuckin head off ey dont be quiet over here im gonna rip your head of 

johnson said did goldmember rip off that helicopter scene  having not seen this movie til now was this the first ever two hander that s effective  walter hill martin breast shine on this movie was delicious 

coulda been shorter  better for critic efficiency  duh  so yeah good shit 

4 non counterfiet counterfiet coins 
yeah  kinda stumbled into this movie actually  i know there s jon woo and other crazy darker gnarlier movies  i don’t even remember why i picked this one  maybe i saw it on action boys or something 

this movie is fuckin fun  this movie is fuckin crazy  i too thought it was a little long  even though breezy as fuck  its stilla  little long  i dunno would change stuff but im glad you guys had fun with it 

gonna give this 4 day saving little piss pots 

i dont have much to say 

i don’t have a ton more to add  i think we just nailed it like  who is this for    what is this movie trying to say 

i gotta say i woulda never thought about this movie critically  everyone knows about toys its toys 1992 weird movie i watched as a kid but never really dug 

doing this now im like  i donno man  i dont think i really jived with whatever the fuck this movie was trying to do 

at the time like this movie ridiculous and kinda fun  but really it s not fun  johnson hammered it was robin williams not doin great in this movie 

ryan said what hes doing and what hes trying to be in this movie im like yeah meh  its visually really stimulating and crazy and can be serios but its really not for kids  yeah i dunno 

im gonna give it uh  1 pea and 1 carrot  so combined its gonna get 2 peas and carrots in a problematic puke pile 

i don’t have a whole lot or ton to add  we coulda talked about this movie for some more obviously theres more content 

i feel like if i knew the story or just the politics around the story going around it  cause now after talking about it  maybe ill read a book about this one day 

as it was happening i was very overwhelmed  i think sam saying crackin the epic movie its a different vibe  its a different experience 

i didnt take a lot of notes  or i was like what the fuck is going on    but not much critique  like just let this thing wash over you like 2 hours 46 minutes  wiht an epic being overwhelmed by it i couldnt think about acting or whatever    just thinking about this is going on 

i dont think it was great or good its definitely not bad  its just not for me at that first watch  i dunno  it will linger for sure  this was a good time 

so i cant say i loved it it definitely was gorgeous to look at  all those people speaking broken english was truly crazy  down the middle 3 turds in a bowl 
i have nothing to say 

i m sorry i missed the first 30 or 40 minutes of the conversation 

we didn t really have that much conversation about it  but i think from your uh  i think i m gonna have to defend this shit  which we are gonna have to do that 

i m a grumpy asshole so this conversation being a week away  this was an interesting  this being a week out with my brain is going to lend me to a be more forgiving of it    i gotta think i take a night before or two nights before and sometimes it can be chore ish  and cause sometimes my brain is made of poop i can make it more of a negative in terms of that reaction 

i can remember that now how the redundancy of the jokes was stupid  but it s not as sharp  yeah uh  trying to remember some of the dumb shit 

dog roll back up the roof  

why  

that s comedically up my alley an unexplained stupid thing 

yeah  there s tons of fun shit regardless of how much the two leads are funny 

okay hake i dunno why i have to say you are a good boy  i think this movie you brought and love to death this movie gets 3 2 minute pisses from a looney bin 

equilibrium 

i think ive finally seen it 

thank you reifenberg for bringing this treasure from your youth and young adulthood into your slightly more adulhood 

being berated by college friends made me sad 

this movie was made after the matrix  after dark city  before the matrix reloaded  pretty original i would say 

gotta give you that 

i dont know how i feel about this movie right now 

i think mostly i like it  but i think    i didnt like it so much maybe i do like it    its one of those things 

i cant tell if its so bad its good or really that bad 

that s where im teetering 

so much of it is just a swing and a miss at certain things that this genre is doing  something kinda young cinematically 

i dunno what you call this type of dystopian gun shit like jon woo doing gun shit now sams got me reading neurmancer or 

any wa this movie is not very good and i dont think this score really matters at all 

take this exactly how i leave you to be in picking a movie that you lvoe sentimentally im gonna give this 4 taye diggss faceses on marble floors 

im gonna go 4444 it 444 s4re

i don’t even know what the fuck im gonna say  sam picking this movie blah blah blah balh i was like dude this movies like fuckin old and boring 

like a bad old boring baseball movie 

when you said field of dreams  i was like yeah thats what this movie is 

thats a slow ass baseball movie  maybe i needa rewatch it  i was like eeeeh this is just wonna those watevers but then it slaps you with 48 year old playing 18 year old 

then guy gets shot immediately  then theres red herrings and who knows wats and like this movie is swinging for the fences pun intended and it works 

like a lot of times  and when it doesnt it works even more cause it so redicously 

i wanna watch again wanna dissect whats going on maybe someone dunno how to do baseball movie but they did it enought hat it just works so i really enoyed watchin this movie so 4 poisoned little morsel terlets 
despite what shaggy said that ive actually seen a version of this movie before… don’t remember that so had no knowledge 

the only things i knew about this movie was from brandon scwartz singing the skid row song every episode  i m a known non musical kinda guy 

so this movie started and i was like   i fuckin hate musicals 

but uh  no its a fun movie 

the cgi s really good 

the stuff is crazy 

when it took a turn i was like  oh this kinda interesting 

im gonna give this 3 glitter lilly funeral arrangements 


 accepts 

reif said it good 

his words were similar to words i thought about 

i too was confused about the two sides of the coin that this movie is 

which i lost my train of thought 

what he said… 

john hughs  its so crazy  i know 16 candels and rivers club  but i didnt see a ton of other stuff but knowing he wrote so many fuckin movies in the 80s  or had his fingers in the pie 

my family is a vacation family 

we know all those  so well  those are the quotes that we know back n front  we do em all day  i miss some of dese movies  lil shoppa horrors  train root with hakes house 

missed on our house 

very simple movie and didnt try to like  we talked about it all 

it was a little more straightforward than i thought it would be  was serious but also not serious 

dang 

i think cause i totally woulda been where johnson is because its quotable and gonna go 4 gnat circumcising hatchets 
office space  rules 

my sister probably showed it to me  maybe that’s when i saw it 

i was probably 12 when this came out  this movie fuckin rocks i woulda put it up for sentimental season 

i think its hilarious its really good i love this movie you guys should love this movie   5 bobs 
the karate kid  from 2010 

this scratched everything i want critically that i want about this podcast we have taken upon ourselves 

its made me think differently about movies 

for like just movies i wanna enjoy i don’t even think about stars or ratings systems  because im like  that cool 

so this one is like a nice warm cup of milk  that i like to take down multiple times per day  fresh from teat 

its like that warm cup of milk that i like to take it down but i dont like to take it down 

you guys know this movie i hopefully come across  its a sports movie  an underdog movie  its an iconic coming of age kid good timey movies ever and doing a great job of expanding in a lot of ways and making stuff better 

jackie chan is so fuckin good 

sam was talking about us being deprived of future jaden roles  i just love this movie because its bruce lee rabbit hole  him doing this type of acting in this movie and hes not really done it since  and this is a little nugget we get of him doign this and this big budget like crazy movie 

i just always loved this movie 

ill leave you guys with this 

kung foo is in everything we do  it lives in how we take jacket on and put jacket off everything we do is kung foo  5 jackets up with attitude 

it’s a movie  ive seen it a few times  alghout i didn’t finish it this time  i figured about what it coulda been  had a few more people gone to see it  we would be livin in the watchowskiverse cut  outcry woulda been a little louder  they said lycantent about a dozen times so i gotta go with 5 flying roller blades 
um 

yeah this is a fuckin movie  this is a real movie 

when uh   johnson annouced this  dhoom  i was like what are you doing  why are you coming up with this shit 

i was like gaahd dammit johnson  fuckin johnson what the hell 

i thought this was gonna be about biker boiz but with fast and furious 

but when it started and its for dudes on bikes  wreck a car  zoom around a truck 

exact beginning of fast n furious  and i was like nobody told me this was fastnfurious and then this movie was soo fucking terrible 

but then i m not screaming every time there s a music scene  i m kinda like boppin  i dunno i had a good time with this movie  its a piece of shit  its not like its so bad its good  but i m glad i experienced it 

imma give it 3 removed sunglasses    err    glasses 


im gonna briefly addon to that  yes  i think like more knowledge of what we talked about like feudal japan and folkore coulda helped me  but there was a point where im not relaly following the songs that they are talking about too well  so im just gonna let this movie wash over me and be its own thing that way 

but then hearing some people talk about some of the details of the movie i was like that sounds like a fuckin cool thing like i feel like there was stuff kinda glossed over that it woulda been too hard for your brain to kinda reach for that  i wa slike im just gonna check out and let these visual go because thats what my brain was prepared to handle right now 

i could see this being like a if i one day learn more about the culture and come back and revisit this  theres something more being told than i was taking in 

but also like sam im gonna give it 3 cursed elongated arms 
clears throat 

i also saw this  at least once  i don’t think i saw it more than that 

sam early viewing   icky

my early viewing   oh oh that’s not mario  alright no  no thank you 

and like disappointed for sure  nowadays this is a terrible movie  this is afuckin bad adaptation  i never desired to go back to it  im super grateful that this happened cause i wouldnadone it on my own  this is  this is not for me  it s not good 

i have to   i have to admit  im kinda unfortunately on the side of those guys that are like  this ruined my childhood  

i didnt see this movie til well after this movie  but like  i fuckin hate this movie and i dont know if theres like peopel     theres people in it  thats cool but this should not even attempt to be super mario brothers  fuck this movie

barring the suits for 10 minutes  they dont do anything  fucking fire out of guns instead of fire flowers fuck this movie and with that im out 1 screaming martini worms 
 without spice 
we are not on arrakis 

this was fun  this was a movie i had never heard of  and it was pretty silly and ridicuoloous and not necessarily great  but it was fun to talk about 

its fun to like  remember kids movies that are just like dont worry about the fuckin plot or anything  its just gonna happen  theres gonna be bright colors and entertain  sure you can drill in there and find some fables and words of wisdom  you ll be fine  its gonna eat an hour of their time 

but hopefully becoming a father here in not too long  i was like  oh that s interesting  oh i like that  brave little toaster huge movie for me as a kid 

i liked it  and its ridiculous  so lets party with that stupid ass movie  4 circuses which are a notion with spiiiiiiiice  bring back scary shit for children 
me personally  i m not a film critic 

sam kinda said  i fuckin love watchin movies  i fuckin love them  but  what this apparently is asking me… im not really about 

so i kinda just had to take it for what it was on my first viewing  but i cant see this movie for the first time without seeing other cohen movies and knowing that they done it better in various other moobies 

i didnt come away with super nego vibes but defo underwhelemed  just whelmed  so i did get a little indignant  but sorry for getting so hot in my curdled milkpants 

but its just like    thats not a funny movie 

you watch it on 8th viewing  like  cool  thats fuckin great  i just didnt find that to be true  not having seen it 8 times  personally 

so with reif  and im happy to see where this started  thats great  knowing where they went  glad i started there 

so with reif  im going to help bring this ridiculous average down and give it 2 curtainless windows 
gattaca was a movie that i thought was a more different movie 

while watching this i had to have a moment with myself after last week s blowup and had to stop thinking what i was gonna get outta this movie and what this movie might be instead of what this movie might give me 

instead of one of those equilibrium type action movies  this is not that at all 

i gotta have a good time with what this is given me 

its kind of this simple commentary on class or genetic engineering  and then its just two white dudes with this goal of  who fucking cares lol 

the line at the end which maybe to shags point is the most bromance of it its like  who the fuck gives a fuck about you  and hes like  i loaned you my name and you loaned me your dream 

and im like   alright that s kinda touching and stuff but im rambling 

3 unmichaelphelpslikebrothers cause i dunno  i didnt particualrly get mad at it or whatever 

thats where you start 
lithography or whatever the fuck  set design tip top 

shag i think you nailed it right there that line you said where they think they can phone it in and it s funny is pretty much my entire takeaway of this movie  we are like  uh yeah its fun its ridiculous its nice its fun its bad whatever  

the thing is i think its so lazy or yeah this is funny shit we got a monkey and greatest action actors ever fuckin give us your money 

i dont wanna give them my money  to ape some of you i dont particularly care for it 2 picken pissen fartin and ass pickens
